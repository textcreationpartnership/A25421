            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Almighty wiſe God hath in divers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry manners ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, that they might know him and his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, and knowing, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in, him, and worſhip him according to his will, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their ſoules: To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we have the Scriptures, which are Gods written Rule of Faith,
<pb facs="tcp:95743:3"/> and Life unto us; the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of men (not of men, but by men) as a ſtanding Ordinance in the Church untill Chriſt come; and the writings of godly and induſtrious men, as adjutory helps. But men have ſought out ſtrange inventions, and that naturall imagination (bordering betwixt ſenſe and reaſon) which is in all men, works out it ſelf in various wayes of oppoſition to revealed truth.</p>
                  <p>This diſcourſe aymes, to give a ſtop to our walking contrary unto God, in our firſt ſettings out to Sin; which (on this ſide naturall corruption) begin at our thoughts.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes wondred to ſee how buſie Satan is in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, whoſe Fancies comply
<pb facs="tcp:95743:3"/> with his ſuggeſtions, to ſubvert the truth once delivered to the Saints. But I check my ſelf again, when I conſider that he is Satan, an adverſary to God and Chriſt, and the ſalvation of men, and that mens imaginations are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wombes, impregnated by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and numerous in their births, as the Serpents in their ſpawne. Amongſt other his wiles, I would immind every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that in nothing, to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, the enemy and his party have prevailed more againſt the truth, and with the fancies of men in our late times, then by diſputing the many doctrines of the Goſpel, in Pulpit, in preſſe, in open, and private Aſſemblies, and that in an irregular way, betwixt weak defendants, and wrangling Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:95743:4"/> (it may be) Jeſuites, or men of Jeſuited principles; for in an orderly way, by them that know how to diſtinguiſh, and before them that are wiſe, I am no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of diſputations, that the truth may be manifeſted, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. But otherwiſe, theſe are the Civill warres raiſed in the Church, and fomented by the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, to divide the Kingdom of Chriſt againſt it ſelf, and bring it to nothing. By this way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention (eſpecially before them that are weak) we have ſeen heaps upon heaps: It's time to grow wiſe for the cauſe of Chriſt, and for our ſelves, leſt we ſuffer theſe ſtumbling ſtones to lye ſo long in the way of weak Chriſtians, that at laſt they be bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as in their proper place, and will not be removed with all our
<pb facs="tcp:95743:4"/> might: Ye have ſometimes ſeen a ſtone caſt into a poole, move a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Circle at the fall, which after multiplies, and widens it ſelf to the bank ſide. We ſometimes find the original of errour to be very ſmall, like a very Center, which inlargeth it ſelf to a circumference, ſuch as imagination will make it; and ſuch ſtrange thoughts are lodged in mens minds, by theſe means, that they are haunted ever after with them, as ſome houſes are ſaid to be with ſpirits of the night. Sober men wiſh that ſome proviſions were made, for the ſafety of ſoules againſt theſe ſpirits: its poſſible, if they that are in power, would be carefull in ſuch a work, their own lives might be bound up in ſuch a proviſion.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Gentle Reader,</hi> Thou ſhalt
<pb facs="tcp:95743:5"/> not need to fear any ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of doubtful diſputation in this ſhort Treatiſe: here is nothing but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and uncontroverted truths, ſuch as may adminiſter Grace unto thee, by the bleſſing of God upon thy read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Thou ſhalt have nothing here leading to a ſtrange God, or another worſhip, but that which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to all Chriſtians, though of divided intereſts, whoſe minds are not blocked up with prejudice againſt the ſober writings of men. This tract teacheth the government of thy own thoughts aright; a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of principal concernment to all men; for hence ariſe, as from their ſpring-head, both words and works of men, and the whole frame of Chriſtian Converſation: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this fountain be clean, the iſſues will be more pure, and if any can
<pb facs="tcp:95743:5"/> ſo purge himſelf of all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit, that his very thoughts are juſt, it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſuch an one hath a Virgin-ſoule, and is perfect, <hi>pro ſtatu via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris,</hi> as a travailer to heaven, though not as one actually poſſeſſed in heaven. And for this end I commend this book to thy read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and meditating thoughts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is an argument rarely handled in print (for ought I know) ſome indeed have brief and accidental notions upon it, but purpoſed tracts of this ſubject, are few in our Engliſh Tongue; and therefore let it be thought the rather uſeful to the Church of God, and a ſubject more fit for that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, to appeare by in the world again: now he is abſent from the body,
<pb facs="tcp:95743:6"/> and preſent with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The Authour of this ſmall Tract was Mr. <hi>John Angel,</hi> who had been twenty years together Lecturer at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and approved by all that knew him, to be a man mighty in word and doctrine, though at laſt clouded by ſome malevolent aſpects upon him, occaſioned (as it is ſaid) not for vice or hereſie, but non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; yet Governments, as men, have their mortalities; and God, who knew to uſe his ſervant in ſeveral places, ſtirred up the hearts of a religious people at <hi>Grantham</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> to ſet him up a Candleſtick there, where he ſhone as a burning light, untill God tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, to ſhine above as a ſtar for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Here, moreover, are no high ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words to amuſe the Reader,
<pb facs="tcp:95743:6"/> but a grave and a plain ſtile ſuited to all, but eſpecially to them that are of lower forms in the School of Chriſt, for the government of their thoughts. I commend it? therefore, to thy reading for the Authours ſake, and for thy ſafety in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; as alſo for the rarity of the ſubject, the general concernment that it is of, and for the plainneſſe of the matter and method thereof. And I leave thee to the Grace of God the Father, and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The thoughts of the Righteous are juſt:</hi> Prov. c. 12. v. 5.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Son of Wiſdom, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the Birth-right, and bleſſing, from all the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who are now, or have been before him: took as ſufficient notice of the orders, rankes, and diſpoſitions of men, as he did of the natures, qualities, and operations
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95743:9"/> of Herbs, Plants, and Trees: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly fitted to every particular, both men, and things, ſuitable Proverbs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what they were, or declaring what they ſhould be: wherein he uſeth a kind of unimitable brevity for memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a frequent oppoſition for perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity. So here, the thoughts of the righteous are juſt; but the counſels of the ungodly are deceit.</p>
                     <p>Now this wiſe Diſcourſer upon Gods ſecrets revealed, and of natures under God, directs his Proverbs unto men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marſhalled into ranks in general, as good or evil; or branched into divers particulars, as the diligent and the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, the humble and proud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And according to this direction of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſubject unto perſons, the Proverbs are either general, or particular.</p>
                     <p>This Proverb in regard of perſons to whom it is directed, ſeems to be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpoken to good men under the name of Righteous. For I obſerve, that <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaks to the better ſort of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the names of good men, righteous men, wiſe, juſt; as he doth to the worſer ſort of men in oppoſition; the evil man,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95743:9"/> the wicked man, the unrighteous, the fool.</p>
                     <p>Three things in the text offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be unfolded.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Who is <hi>Salomons</hi> Righteous man.</item>
                        <item>2. What be his thoughts.</item>
                        <item>3. How they are ſaid to be juſt.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, if ye ask who is <hi>Salomons</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man; I anſwer, as before, he that is a good man, a juſt man, a wiſe man.</p>
                     <p>But further, when in Scripture a man hath the denomination of a Righteous one; it is either from the juſtice of Chriſt imputed, which is abſolute in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, though relative in apprehenſion; or from that inward and inherent reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſoul and body, whereby God makes a man righteous in himſelf habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and in his courſe of life, ſuitable in kind, though not in meaſure, unto that primary juſtice which was in <hi>Adam.</hi> Or thirdly, a man is called righteous in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, becauſe he is apprehended by himſelf in his own thoughts, or judged by others, to be righteous, by his words and deeds.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95743:10"/>
                     <p> This Proverb though it exclude not the juſt man by imputation, yet it eſpecially points out him that is juſt by renovation, and in appearance, who is not onely real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted ſuch, in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; but alſo made ſuch by the ſpirit of Chriſt, and known by himſelf to be ſuch by his habituated thoughts, and appearing to the world to be ſuch by his words and deeds. This is <hi>Salomons</hi> righteous man, a man righteous in Gods acceptation, a man made righteous by renovation, a man righteous in his own perſwaſion, and in the worlds reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing to be unfolded is, What the thoughts of the Righteous be. I anſwer, God, the firſt producer of all things, who made the mind of man, uſeth it alſo to bring forth all reaſonable and humane actions, as a free agent under himſelf; and to this end, hath ordained in it a power to frame thoughts and to diſpoſe them towards action; that by theſe the ſoul might move it ſelf conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually toward the chief good, and by them may communicate her ſelf with earthly things, natural and humane. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95743:10"/> mind inclined and moved by God the firſt cauſe hath motions within it ſelf, called thoughts; and of theſe there are two ſorts, whereof the firſt receive their determination within the ſoul, and in the ſame have their perfection, being therein produced, and reflecting upon the mind, put themſelves forth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The other ſort are the immediate fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of actions; whether it be that the ſoul lift up it ſelf to communion with God in divine contemplation, that ſhe may utter her ſelf in prayer or praiſes: or communicate her ſelf with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in lower reſolutions, and actions. <hi>Theſe private ſtirrings of the ſoul within doors, are the thoughts of men; and when they are juſt, they are the thoughts of the Righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe thoughts of men are various and infinite, according to their variety of objects about which they are converſant; <hi>But when their firſt mover is God, and Gods glory their end propounded, and a wiſe man the diſpoſer of them, they are juſt thoughts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus we are led to the third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95743:11"/> which is, How the thoughts of the righteous are ſaid to be juſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Things are ſaid to be right or juſt many wayes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that is right which hath rectitude from it ſelf, and is the cauſe of rectitude in every other thing; and ſo God onely is righteous.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, things are ſaid to be right which have rectitude from another; yet there is in them ſuch an equity conferred, that they are made infallible rules, for men to ſquare all their actions by them; and thus the Law, and the whole reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will of God is righteous.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, things are ſaid to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which are ordered and done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule; whether perfectly as the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt God-man, which anſwered fully to the rule of Gods will revealed, both for kind and degree; or proportionably and acceptably, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſomething is done according to rule, though not fully and without aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet well in compariſon of what wicked men do, and holding ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the rule, and finding accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, who ſupplies the want<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95743:11"/> of ſuch righteous men from the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In this ſenſe the thoughts of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are juſt <hi>(viz.)</hi> comparatively with the thoughts of wicked men, though not fully according to the rule, yet holding ſome proportion with it, and having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptability with God.</p>
                     <p>Thus having unfolded the words, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the ſcope or ſpecial intention in this Proverb, is to deliver to the world the true ground of all pious and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and juſt actions, which is next and immediately under God, the thoughts of the righteous.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>Ye have heard the Proverb ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: and it appeares to be a Doctrine of it ſelf, affording a ſtable and ſufficient ground unto a holy courſe of life in word and deed. The Argument and matter-ſubject of this Treatiſe, is this, To ſhew, that he which is a righteous man in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, by the ſpirits ſanctification, in his own perſwaſion, and the worlds reputation, ought to have juſt thoughts, and to be the Maſter, or Governour of them; he muſt endeavour to get them into his mind, and having gotten them, it is required, that he rightly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, for the orderly and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able producing of their effects in words and deeds.</p>
                     <p>The government of his thoughts is a righteous mans great buſineſſe, of great neceſſity, and of much difficulty. It's
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95743:12"/> day work, and night work, with him: his meditations are alwayes upon it; he ſo delights in the Law of the Lord, <hi>that</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>he meditates in it day and night.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <bibl>Pſal. 1. 2.</bibl> Some are careful of their actions, that by them they give no offence to the weak, nor lay ſtumbling-blocks in the way of them that are without. Theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable amongſt the godly: others go further, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>they keep their lips as it were with a bridle, and they are purpoſed that their mouths ſhall not tranſgreſſe;</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Pſal. 39. 1. Pſal. 17. 3.</bibl> yet few people go ſo far as to take heed to their thoughts. It ſeems all men are not aware of it, that their inward thoughts may be very wickedneſſe: but a wiſe man thoroughly inſtructed, and ſanctified by the Spirit of God, loves the Law of God with ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, that he hates thoſe floating va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his thoughts, which riſe in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it. <hi>I hate vain thoughts,</hi> (ſaid that righteous man) <hi>but thy Law do I love.</hi>
                        <bibl>Pſal. 119. 113.</bibl>
                     </p>
                     <p>And every juſt man doth ſo govern his thoughts, that they are generally good. I do not ſay that every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thought of a righteous man is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95743:13"/> juſt: <hi>David</hi> had his exorbitancies in thoughts, or elſe they had not ſo much appeared in his doings; and yet his heart was right with God for the main. And ſo it is with many of Gods dear children, they have excurrent and ſinful thoughts, the knowledge whereof, give many a ſecret prick upon their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; though they have good meanings, and good hearts generally. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>Aſa,</hi> that the high places were not taken away out of Iſrael in his days; <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>nevertheleſſe the heart of</hi> Aſa <hi>was perfect all his dayes.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <bibl>2 Chro. 15. 18.</bibl> A righteous man may ſometimes think fooliſhly, as well as ſpeak unadviſedly with his lips, or put his hands unto wickedneſſe; Yet as his words and workes are for the main end, regulated by the word of God, ſo are his thoughts. A righteous man is the maſter of juſt thoughts. And though Maſter-workmen may ſometimes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in their lines and meaſures, and ſorting their materials; yet not like them that have no skill in building. If a righteous man meditate in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, he will have reſpect unto Gods wayes.<bibl>Pſal. 119. 15.</bibl>

                     <p> Take the reaſon of the righteous mans practiſe, on this behalf.</p>
                     <p>Firſt his thoughts are moved upon by the Spirit of God; though God be not in all the thoughts of the wicked; yet the righteous, God leads by his Spirit, and guides by his counſel. There are many that are <q rend="inline">

                     <p> 7. Good thoughts are comfortable to our ſoules, and therefore we had need to govern our thoughts juſtly: our thoughts in ſome ſort are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable then either good words or works, a man may take the trueſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his gracious ſtature, by his own thoughts. It is our joy and Crown of rejoycing before men and Angels, if we can ſay with Paul, we have lived in all good conſcience toward God.<bibl>Acts 23. 1.</bibl> To have ſuch an even courſe in morality, honeſty, charity, as gives ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the good, and ſtoppes the mouths of gain-ſayers, and to have ſuch a government of words as may teach ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, hurt none, profit all, is a great mercy: yet this will not ſatisfy nor give true warrant of comfort to the ſoul, no nor make our outward obedience acceptable to God, till we have purified our hearts, and ſet in order our thoughts from whence words and works, do ariſe: A man may keep a fair Quarter with the world, obtain a good reputation for commendable morality, be well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed for outward rites of Religion, yet have thoughts as black as hell, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95743:18"/> as Sodom: he that ſaid, hail Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Chriſt, and kiſſed him, was the Traytour among the twelve, and while a ſoule is ſo filthy within, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can ſhe have of any thing outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done? Oh when a ſoule is ſtung with fiery Serpents, and the great red dragon hath wrapped the poor wretch under him, Where ſhall he find comfort and peace? Doſt thou think to find comfort in thy works? Comfort is not there, for they were done but in forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and hypocriſy; paſſe to thy words. Comfort is not there, for words are wind, masked too often according to the judgement of thy betters, the ſway of the times, thy own projects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in hand: moſt men minding to put on a ſeemingneſſe of good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Herod</hi> did to worſhip the babe Chriſt, few walking in the uprightneſs of their hearts, and according to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>If therefore thou wouldſt find peace and comfort in times of temptation, turn into thy own thoughts, if thou findeſt them ſwept and garniſhed, ſweet and well diſpoſed, thou mayeſt aſſure

The good or evill of a mans thoughts lye in the dark to the eyes of other men,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95743:20"/> unleſſe evidenced by ſome further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of it in words or geſture, or deed: but God with whom we have to do, ſeeth all things as clear as in the day; for night and day are to him alike: what avayles then to hide from men, while God looks on, who will one day be our judge?</p>
                     <p>And thus much concerning the great need, which we have of the right government of our thoughts: They are the fountains of all actions, good or evill: evill thoughts are ſinne, and the occaſions of ſinne, and God will puniſh for them. But good thoughts are pleaſing unto God, they unite us unto God: they are comfortable to our own ſoules, and God knowes all our thoughts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us labour to be the Maſters of good thoughts, and to govern them aright.</p>
                     <p>I might adde that a man hath a good companion, yea many good companions toward Heaven, that hath alwayes good thoughts with him; others ſit ſolitary, and complain for want of company, but a man of a large

                     <p>I Have proved that the getting and governing of his thoughts is neceſſary to the well-being of a juſt mans life; let me proceed to declare the common errours and exorbitancies of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians thoughts: which though it be a thing difficult conſidering the variety and multiplicity of the ſouls unkind progeny of evil thoughts: yet by Gods grace, I will adventure in the humility of my ſoul, to give you my thoughts in this matter.</p>
                     <p>The ſoul is the nobler part of man, fitted of God unto the greateſt workes; to wit, the contemplation of himſelf, and of heavenly things; or the framing of our actions to earthly ſubjects, with reference to Gods glory, and its own ſalvation; yet ſometimes, it leaves off its noble work, and contrary to her eſſential being, thinkes of nothing at all, or contrary to its well-being, thinks
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95743:21"/> of that which is unprofitable: in both theſe reſpects, the thoughts of men and women, are not juſt.</p>
                     <p>The firſt common errour of our thoughts may not unfitly be called, dulneſſe or drowſineſſe of thoughts, when imagination is dull and thinks of nothing at all, or but ſleepily: it ſometimes happens that the mindes of men are as it were dead within them; <q rend="inline">

                     <p>The ſecond errour of our thoughts, is when our imaginations are buſie, but they act not to any profitable end to our ſelves or others, for prevention of evil, or attainment of good; and too often they act to wicked ends, to the harme of our ſelves and of others. The firſt of theſe two we may call the vanity of thoughts; the other the wickedneſſe of thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, there is a very vanity in ſome mens thoughts; ſo the Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vain in their imaginations, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <q rend="inline">

                        <bibl>1 Tim. 4. 7</bibl>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would be an endleſſe labour to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95743:22"/> tell you in what variable manner the mindes of men are enclined to ſix their thoughts upon matters, according to their diſpoſition, education, place, or company; nothing poſſeſſeth the brains of ſome, but toyes, fancies, humours, faſhions, diſcourſes of <hi>Robin-Hood,</hi> tales of <hi>Southamptons Beavis,</hi> &amp;c. or that <hi>Athenian</hi> diſpoſition, and unwearied deſire to hear news of others, with an idle invention how to utter the ſame complementally to others; ſome mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gameing and ſports, hawking, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others new faſhions, good-fellowſhip, mirth, and jeſtings, which are not convenient.</p>
                     <p>Theſe vain thoughts are eſpecially appropriated to the worſer ſort of men and women; yet the beſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren want not ſome out-runnings in this kind. But it would be conſidered that theſe thoughts are vain imaginations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; for they neither lift the ſoul to communion with God upward, nor have reference to the ſetling of the ſouls peace inward, nor direct the ſoul to the performance of any warrantable action in its courſe downward. Such are all the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95743:23"/> daughters of this imaginary vanity.</p>
                     <p>If it be here objected, that God hath granted thoughts recreatory for the ſouls wearineſſe, as well as exerciſe for the bodies relief; it is true indeed; but theſe thoughts muſt be ſquared by theſe rules, or elſe they be not exempted from vanity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The object of recreatory thoughts, muſt be things that are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truly indifferent; for we are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſubject to be partial, our thoughts blinded by affection, rather than led by judgement out of the Law of God. What we think to be no hurt, may be, and often is, no leſſe poiſonful than Hen-bane.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt admit them as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to our better and more neceſſary thoughts, leſt ſervants ride on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and Princes go on foot.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They muſt not take up over much time, leſt inſtead of fitting the minde thereby to better thoughts, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude good thoughts altogether.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We muſt be wary, leſt under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of theſe indifferent things for the mindes recreation, Satan do not faſten
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95743:23"/> upon us ſome deadly temptation; for theſe recreatory thoughts are not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the bands to bring in ſome other filthy ſins; wherefore if thoſe which thou calleſt recreatory thoughts be ſinful, if they take up a diſproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, if they faſten upon thee any wicked temptation, if they enfeeble thy mind from better thoughts; be thou aſſured, they have a meaſure of vanity in them. What though ſome plead for theſe things? as are the thoughts, ſo is the man. The ſervants of Chriſt ſhall find, that when they give way to ſuch thoughts, the holy courſes of their ſouls are interrupted; their peace which ought to be dear unto them is endangered, their pretious and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable time ſpent, and their inward man ſeldom ſends them away without diſturbance. Let the thoughts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of vain matters paſſe for vain thoughts.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond vanity of thoughts is the unſtayedneſſe or levity of them; which is a kind of ſhuttleneſſe or ſickleneſſe of our thoughts; the mind in this reſpect, whether converſant about good or evil,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95743:24"/> may not unfitly be compared unto the unſtable eyes of the Adulterer, which be in every corner of the houſe; now in heaven ſoaring aloft, immediately in hell diving beneath; or like the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which flaſheth in a moment out of the Eaſt, into the Weſt. Theſe may be called wandering imaginations, our mindes being naturally ſubject in this manner, to ſtray out of their appointed limits, as <hi>Dinah</hi> out of her fathers houſe, with no leſſe danger than ſhe found ſhame. <q rend="inline">This vanity the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeems to note unto us, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the blindneſſe of the Gentiles hearts, he tells us, <hi>That they walke in the vanity of their mindes; having their underſtandings darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Eph. 4. 7. 18.</bibl> They had walking imaginations, but they were in the dark, and therefore wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in uncertainties. Such roving unſetled thoughts there was in the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when ſometimes they were in their thoughts for <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſometimes for <hi>Aſſyriah:</hi> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Prophet to complain of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95743:24"/> them: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Why gaddeſt thou about ſo much to change thy way? thou ſhalt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of</hi> Egypt,<hi>as thou waſt of</hi> Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah.</q>
                        <bibl>Jerem. 2. 36.</bibl>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Errour, as all others; began from the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> before which, the mind being aſſured of its chief good, was moved in a ſtable manner about that Center, as the Stars equally about the Pole; but thenceforth loſing her enjoyment of the chief good; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof having the fruition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſeeming goods, it became like a Planet, or wandring Star, carried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayedly, or uncertainly about the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Roveings are eſpecially in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine men, and ſuch as are moſt remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from undiſtempred melancholly; for doubtleſſe melancholly perſons in their beſt temper, have the moſt ſolid and fixed imaginations, as the ſanguine and cholerick the moſt moveable: but the wanderings of imagination, they breed a diſturbance in every action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the mind is employed, a diſturbance ſenſible to any who carry about them an obſervant eye. Yet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95743:25"/> Gods ſervants find the moſt apparent harme by ſuch thoughts, when they ſet themſelves about heavenly buſineſſe; ſuppoſe prayer, or meditation, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <bibl>Gen. 15. 11</bibl> If <hi>Abraham</hi> be about his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the birds come down and trouble him, till they be frighted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: ſo while we are about Gods worſhip, theſe kind of thoughts do moſt; of all moleſt us. It is a hard matter to keep the ſoul to a ſtable motion of thoughts: but moſt difficult when 'tis exerciſed about ſupernatural duties; For now the Devil who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies our good, and the glory of God in ſuch duties, caſteth into our mindes vain and impertinent thoughts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our mindes themſelves are unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and indiſpoſed to ſuch work na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally; and though where grace is, there may be a willingneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet there is alſo a weakneſſe of fleſh.</p>
                     <p>But it may be ſome will be ſo far from accounting this an errour, that they will rather call it variety of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, quickneſſe of wit, ſharpneſſe of underſtanding: and the contrary, no
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95743:25"/> better than dull melancholly, or block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſtupidity.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer theſe; There is a wide difference betwixt this unſtayed courſe of thoughts, and true, and quick, or ſharp invention, or wit: For firſt this levity of thoughts is from an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of impertinent imaginations, hindering, if not fruſtrating the maine intendment; whereas variety of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and quickneſſe of wit, truly ſo called, is a quick minding and managing of thoughts ſuitable to the project in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Again unſtayed thoughts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the heart from reſolutions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for bringing forth actions. But quickneſſe of underſtanding is the beſt Midwife for ſpeedy delivery of the ſoul from the hard labour of unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſſe, into an eſtate of liberty to act freely and ſtoutly.</p>
                     <p>The third vanity of thoughts is, when as to the end propounded, or which ought to be, they are unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Some have working imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, never idle, alwayes buſie; but as good never a whit, as never the better. Some think themſelves to be wiſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95743:26"/> above other men; <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>but they imagine vain things, and the Lord knowes the thoughts of thoſe wiſe men that they are vain.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Pſal. 2. 1. 1 Cor. 3. 20.</bibl> The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> time were wholly bent to the maintenance of <hi>Moſes</hi> Ceremonies; which yet the Apoſtle taxeth as <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>unprofitable to thoſe that were occupied in them: for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is a diſanulling of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment going before, becauſe of the unprofitableneſſe thereof.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Heb. 7. 18.</bibl> Thoſe fooliſh Queſtions about the Law edifie not; but rather turn to the ſubverſion of the hearers, and by conſequence are not profitable in Apoſtolical judgement. There are that trouble themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Queſtions, and ſtrife of words;<bibl>1 Tim. 6. 4.</bibl> but mark what Mark the Apoſtle puts upon them: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>They are proud, knowing nothing, men of corrupt mindes:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>ver. 5.</bibl> if their mindes were not corrupt, they would not trouble themſelves about ſuch matters.</p>
                     <p>This errour is moſt common in theſe forward times, wherein the moſt refined wits, and ſharpeſt inventions, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably taken up with needleſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, fruitleſſe, and curious, if not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95743:26"/> curſed arts, fooliſh ſpeaking, witty jeaſtings, and a thouſand ſuch unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary impertinencies, not deſtinated unto any good end, the accompliſhment whereof never brings any true content to the party, nor any profit to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. This fault, howſoever many make ſmall account of, as thinking it a great glory to be accounted knowing or witty: or thinking it a ſufficient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not to be idle, or in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their thoughts not to be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; yet thoſe that know all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be reſpective unto ſome good, and content not themſelves with a bare negation of evil, cannot but abhor the unprofitableneſſe of their thoughts.</p>
                     <p>And is it not pitty to ſee men ſpend ſuch pretious time, and lay out ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valueable gifts, as ſome have acquired, in purchaſing that which profits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Its pitty ſuch wine as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſome veſſels, ſhould run at waſte, and do no man good. And this is ſo much the more to be regarded and pitied, becauſe where this unprofitable vanity of the mind reigns, it fills the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95743:27"/> of men with ſuch vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in their frothy undertakings, that they become utterly uncapable of any courſe of ſtudy, or endeavour to do good unto the Church of God. Of our thoughts therefore as of our actions, let this be a general rule: They muſt be deſtined unto ſome good end: for it matters not with what earneſtneſſe or with what eagerneſſe we purſue them, unleſſe directly, or by conſequent they be in ſome way profitable.</p>
                     <p>The fourth vanity of our thoughts appears, in the diſorderlineſſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of them; it ſometimes happens that the Devil cannot faſten upon us a deadneſſe of thoughts, nor lodge vain imaginations in our hearts, nor cauſe us to wander in uncertain cogitations, nor caſt our minds into the mould of unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable inventions: but that by the grace of God we are in ſome meaſure freed from all theſe; and then he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make confuſion and diſorder amongſt our moſt profitable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary inventions, and reſolutions: for though the thoughts of a good man be warrantable in themſelves, and intended
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95743:27"/> for a good end; yet the order of them may be ſo confuſed, that the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is impeded, if not diſappointed. As in a courſe of ſpeech long and often parentheſes, darken the ſpeakers mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hinder the apprehenſion of the hearer: So in thoughts, and in things of continued action, impertinencies and out-runnings, diſgrace the courſe and ſpeedy performance. When the thoughts of a mans mind are double, the man is a tottering thing: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Satan can bring a man to double-mindedneſſe, he knows he will be unſtable in all things, political or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious: for <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>a double-minded man is unſtable in all his wayes:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Jam. 1. 8.</bibl> and then he hath gotten much advantage of him, by this wile.</p>
                     <p>Behold this thing in thy ſelf: firſt what an unpleaſant accident, in thy ſoul (when formerly well ſetled) is this confuſion of thoughts, though good in themſelves: as when amongſt thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meditations and ſpiritual cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there creep into thy minde thoughts of profit, lawful pleaſures, or neceſſary labours, which howſoever
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95743:28"/> they be not onely permitted, but alſo commanded of God to have a place in our thoughts, at their times, and in their order; for there is a time for all things: yet ruſhing in at the time of thy devotions, they put all out of order.</p>
                     <p>further as they are unpleaſant, ſo they are diſturbant: A devoted heart cannot indure interruption in ſpiritual duties, by worldly attendance, or other occaſions from without. <q rend="inline">While Chriſt was about his Fathers buſineſſe, he likes not the importunity of brothers or ſiſters, that ſtand without to ſpeak with him.</q> Suppoſe a ſoul upon ſome extraordinary occaſion, reſolve upon a courſe of thoughts to humble himſelf; How troubleſom are cogitations of joy and rejoyceing? <q rend="inline">Who would not now ſhut the door upon them, as intruders unſent for, and unwelcome; like water in a ſhip, or like ſnow in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. God requires a ſeaſon for our thoughts; and therefore likes not a hudling confuſion of them: as the Lord hath appointed labour to fit every
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95743:28"/> perſon, and to fit every time; ſo he hath appointed ſuitable thoughts for every occaſion. When we are about Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, God hath appointed one ſort of thoughts to poſſeſſe our minds, and when we are about our Callings ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our minds muſt have their changeable ſuites, as well as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: the working day hath his thoughts, and the Sabbath his: vain thoughts are no more lawful on the Sabbath, than vain words are. He that ſaid, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak thine own words, nor do thy own workes,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not think thine own thoughts.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Iſai. 58. 13.</bibl>
                     </p>
                     <p>What we are about, if it be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and ſeaſonable, God would have our hearts and hands to intend it: otherwiſe diſorder cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. The phanſie of men that is but natural, left to its own wilde way of working, and not modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by reaſon, will make ſtrange compoſitions and mixtures, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of things preſented to it by the ſenſes, as we ſee in dreames:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95743:29"/> and if grace moderate not, there will be ſtrange confuſions in the thoughts of men. If therefore our thoughts be confuſed: I cannot reckon them among the thoughts of the Righteous, <q rend="inline">

                     <p>HItherto I have diſcovered ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of thoughts, as dulneſſe, and vanity: which laſt appears. Firſt, when the mind is buſied about vain objects. Secondly, when the mind it ſelf is looſe and unſtayed. Thirdly, When the mind propounds no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable end. Fourthly, When the thoughts are diſordered or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now ſpeak of ſome other vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our thoughts, which go far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe hitherto mentioned; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not errour onely joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, but alſo apparent wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. Thoſe already ſpoken of are native infirmities, in all men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo the beſt of men are faulty more or leſſe in them: but there remain yet two other exorbitancies of thoughts which are incident to the minds and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95743:30"/> thoughts of the worſt men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; and from which regenerate perſons are in a great meaſure ſet free.</p>
                     <p>Let us come to ſpeak of the firſt ſort of theſe wicked thoughts. I call them wicked, for they have not onely vanity in them, but alſo ſin: and this is, when thoughts of evil draw in the will and affections to a complacency, to a wiſhing and longing, and ſometimes a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire to enjoy ſome unlawlfull thing: ſuppoſe an unlawful pleaſure, or ſome unjuſt gain, ungodly honour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable victory, bloody ſpoyle, or ſuch like.<bibl>Gen.</bibl> So <hi>Eve</hi> ſaw the forbidden fruit, as a thing to be deſired: ſo <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> luſted after his ſiſter <hi>Thamar,</hi> till he became as one of the fooles of Iſrael. So <hi>Ahab</hi> coveted <hi>Naboth</hi>'s vineyard, till he was ſick with deſiring, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in gaining the poſſeſſion. So <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi> thought of a kingdom, and is and ſo ambitiouſly covetous of it, that he attempts to uſurp the Crown, though by unnatural rebellion againſt his Father: This is that which the Apoſtle calls <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the</hi>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95743:30"/> 
                           <hi>luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>1 John 2. 16.</bibl> which are the three great idols of the world.</p>
                     <p>This wickedneſſe in thoughts ſo farre pleaſeth ſome, that when they cannot enjoy the thing deſired, yet they account it a ſpeculative happineſs, to have the thing deſired in their minds, though it be but an image there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: it pleaſeth the covetous man to dream of his Bonds, Bills, Morgages, Aſſurances, dayes of payment; and this earthly mindedneſſe, will let him mind nothing elſe: ſo another toſſeth fleſhly pleaſures from one thought to another, and from one deſire to another, &amp; when the power of the fleſh periſheth in them, they grow to feed their phanſies with contemplative fornications; in the like caſe the contentious man dreams of wrangling ſuits, the man of blood of fire and faggots, ſwords and battels. Thus the great mans thoughts are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with his honours, revenues, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendancies; the Gallant with his gay clothes, the old man pleaſeth his phanſy with remembrances and diſcourſes of what he hath been, and what he hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95743:31"/> done, the young man with what he may be: his hopes and poſſibilities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light him, as if they were preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: thus the imagination of things that are not, work upon us the ſame affections, as if they were. <hi>Jacob</hi> doth as feelingly grieve for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed death of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as if he had been dead indeed, and ſo men take the ſame delight in their ſuppoſed wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes, as if they were really effected.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like thoughts in the heart, are the things which defile a man; whether they be proud imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or covetous thoughts, thoughts of revenge againſt others, or thoughts of Blaſphemy againſt God; of what kind ſoever our thoughts are, if they draw in the will to conſent unto their evill, they are wicked thoughts; they are wicked, <hi>ſuo genere,</hi> in their own nature: but when they work the will into co-partnerſhip, they are higher in the degree of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe; it is ſin but to think that which is evil, but to think of it with liking and conſent, is a greater degree of ſin: God reproves him, and ſetteth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95743:31"/> his ſins in order before his face, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>who ſaw the thief and conſented unto him, and was partaker with the adulterer.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond ſort of wicked thoughts come to paſſe, when the thoughts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained upon the heart to delight in evil, and with a kind of roveing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to expect it; the underſtanding alſo is drawn in, by an opinion of an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary happineſſe to plot and beſtirre it ſelf unto the furtheſt of its natural or acquired invention, to produce by all means the evil thought upon, into action.</p>

                     <p>ANd thus I have alſo diſcovered thoſe evil thoughts which ſurpaſſe the dulneſſe, and vanities of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themſelves evil; <q rend="inline">and infecting the heart with wicked complacency, and the underſtanding with wicked inventions.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus far proceeded in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the errours, and wickedneſſe of mens thoughts. I ſhall now endeavour by the aſſiſtance of God, to preſcribe ſome remedies or means of redreſſe: and the Remedies will be of two ſorts: the firſt equally oppoſe all errours of our throughts, whether dull, or vain, or wicked: the ſecond are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fitted to cure ſome kind or other, and not ſo much reſpecting all.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the mind that travelleth, and feeleth it ſelf heavy laden with any of the former incumbrances and would be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95743:33"/> refreſhed with the reſt of God: muſt make a conſcience of his thoughts; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common opinion of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſts, and time-ſerving Formaliſts, who think, and often ſay it, That Thought is free, and that if they can refrain ſuch words and works as are of evil report and puniſhable, then their peace is ſound, and themſelves juſt, though their thoughts be black as hell, and conform to the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. And indeed, thoughts are free from puniſhment by the Laws of men, which onely reach to the outward man; and a man is not bound by Law, or any duty, to reveale all his thoughts unto another. <hi>Salomon</hi> tells us, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>That a prating fool, or a man of fooliſh lips ſhall fall:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Prov. 10. 8.</bibl> But the good man muſt perſwade himſelf that the Lord takes notice of, abhors, and will puniſh evil thoughts, as the breaches of his Law, therein extending more than the laws of men. It is a known diſtinction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all, that there are ſins of thought, as much as ſins of word or of deed. We read of ſome that erre, becauſe <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>they imagine evil:</hi>
                        </q> of ſome that ſinned
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95743:34"/> becauſe <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>they tempted God in their hearts:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Prov. 14. 22. Pſal. 78. 18. Pſal. 58. 2. </bibl> of others that <hi>did work wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe in their heart.</hi> Our Saviour gives a check to the Scribes for their evil thoughts; <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Mat. 9. 4.</bibl> Yea in the Court of Conſcience, and in Gods ſight, evil thoughts are in ſome reſpect, more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (or leſſe excuſeable) than either words or deeds. What is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſin of unbelief: what that of hypocriſie, whoſe puniſhment in Hell is the pattern how other ſins ſhall be puniſhed? They are not ſins of word, they are not ſins of work; but ſins of the inward parts, of the mind, and of the heart. Conſider further upon this matter, and ye ſhall perceive.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That evil thoughts are Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders to other ſins: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>all other unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſses begin at the heart,</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Mat. 15. 18.</bibl> whether they be <hi>blaſphemies, or falſe-witneſſing,</hi> which are ſins of the tongue, <hi>or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and adulteries,</hi> which are ſins of deed. From contemplative wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we go on to actual: ſo <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>luſt</hi> (within, <hi>when it hath conceived,</hi> at temptation without) <hi>brings forth ſin.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <bibl>Jam. 1. 15</bibl>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95743:34"/> Imagination is the great wheel of the ſoul: if that move amiſſe, all the whole man runs at random: for as the phanſie conceives, the judgement concludes, the will chooſeth, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions purſue, or eſchew, and the members of the body execute. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in regard of precedency, or cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, ſins of thought are more ſinful, or inexcuſeable, than either words or deeds.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Our thoughts are more at liberty than our words or actions: there is leſſe byas hanging upon our thoughts, than upon our outward man. As theſe are more free from the ſhame of the World, the cenſure of enemies, the puniſhment of outward laws, the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of godly brethren: ſo they are leſſe ſwayed by hopes of favour from ſuch we love or reverence, or hope to riſe by. In evil times eſpecially, many things may afford excuſe for miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in our words or deeds. Many dangers are following them that are of free language and open works which in this frailty of the fleſh, may put on our outward faults a mincing infirmity; but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95743:35"/> none, nor any of theſe, can any way diminiſh the fault of our thoughts. For notwithſtanding all theſe, our thoughts are freed from the byas of fear or favour. <hi>Jonathan</hi> could love <hi>David</hi> as his own ſoul, though he went in his Father <hi>Sauls</hi> Army, which hunted him as a Partridge upon the mountains. <hi>Obadiah</hi> thought reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of the Lords Prophets, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved many of them from the cruel rage of <hi>Jeſabel:</hi> though he lived in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court: But if the inward parts be wickedneſſe, there is no faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thoſe ſinners: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>There is no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedneſs.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <bibl>Pſal. 5. 9.</bibl> Its poſſible, God may have ſome whoſe hearts are right with him in evil times, though they halt in their words and outward behaviour: But if the thoughts of the heart and mind be evil, whatſoever the outward appearance is, there is no believing of ſuch.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The temptations of Satan have not ſuch power over our thoughts, as they have in our outward man, in as much as the Devil is no ſearcher of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95743:35"/> hearts, and therefore cannot ſo eaſily puddle theſe fountains, as he doth, by Gods permiſſion, our words and deeds. I do not ſay Satan hath no power, but not ſuch power. The Devil knows the conſtitution and temperament of mens bodies, and can move the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and by them he can ſtir up the affections: he can repreſent falſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by the ſenſes unto the cogitative faculty: and thereby diſorder the thoughts: But he hath not ſuch an immediate illapſe, or entrance into the heart, as into our outward ſenſes: and by how much our thoughts receive leſs violence and oppoſition from Satan, by ſo much the ſins of our thoughts are leſſe excuſeable: as he is leſſe a ſinner that ſins by temptation, than he that ſinneth without.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, Our words and deeds bring more damage unto others, and breed a greater ſcandal amongſt the good, than our thoughts do. I anſwer, Yes: and therefore God condemns out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions that are ſinful: But the evil of our thoughts are as filthy in our ſelves, and as open to the eyes of God,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95743:36"/> as our actions are: and God who eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reſpects our ſpirits, whether in mortification to ſin, or in quickning to righteouſneſſe: hath equally forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our thoughts, as our words or deeds. He that ſaid, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſſe, Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi>
                        </q> ſaid alſo, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore we ought to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious care of our evil thoughts, as of our evil deeds; we muſt account them ſinful, and puniſhable: and take heed how we receive in thoughts, hand over head. Good thoughts indeed ſhould be welcom'd when they come, leſt we be found to reſiſt the Spirit of God; for in a motion upon thy thoughts the Spirit of life may come into thy ſoul. But on the other hand, if evil thoughts do offer themſelves, we ought to keep them out.</p>
                     <p>I have inſiſted upon this remedy the longer, becauſe until this be cleared up to the judgement that thoughts are ſins, and puniſhable, and we ought to make a conſcience of them, all other remedies of evil thoughts will be unprofitable, and the mind wil be peſtered with them.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:95743:36"/>
                     <p> The ſecond General Remedy againſt evil thoughts is. Let a man judge and condemn himſelf for evil thoughts: there is no man living can ſay his heart is clean: and 'tis meet that a Chriſtian feel a trouble and heavineſſe within him, wrought by that diſorder and trouble that is in his thoughts. <hi>Paul</hi> is our pattern, crying out, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Oh wretched man that I am.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Rom. 7. 24.</bibl> Let us think it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for us to cry out againſt that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of evil thoughts within us, that God may deliver us from them:<bibl>Pſ. 51.</bibl> we ſhall never have true and ſound peace in our ſelves, unleſſe our hearts <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>be clean created within us.</hi>
                        </q> The Phariſee which <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>cleanſeth the outſide of the platter,</hi>
                        </q> hath no true comfort while his inward parts <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>are full of ravening and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Luc. 11. 39, 40.</bibl> For he that made that which is without, made that which is within alſo. There is no ſweetneſſe in that ſoul, which is a whited tombe without, and rotten bones within. Doſt thou look at that which is without? and doſt thou condemn thy ſelf for any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comelineſſe there? Thou doſt well: for God made the outſide, and Chriſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95743:37"/> purchaſed the outſide: but forget not to look at that which is within; and if any ſinfulneſſe be there, judge and condemn thy ſelf for it: for God made the inſide, and Chriſt purchaſed the inſide. It is a Wiſe mans counſel: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>If thou haſt thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Prov. 30. 32.</bibl> evil thoughts ſhould be ſtopped before they get out upon the tongue: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Surely the churming of milke brings forth butter:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Prov. 30 33.</bibl> and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and agitating of evil thoughts will bring forth ſin. Stop them up therefore, and condemn thy ſelf for them: that they break not out, to thy ſhame, and danger.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſet your ſelves againſt evil and vain thoughts, and be not quiet till ye have in ſome meaſure cleanſed your minds of them. Evil thoughts are not worthy to paſſe into your minds; much leſſe to keep houſe there. <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from</hi> 
                        <bibl>Jer. 4. 14.</bibl> 
                        <hi>wickedneſs: how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Evil and vaine thoughts are bold intruders, they will come, yet let them not ſtay to take up lodging with thee. There are many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95743:37"/> birds that are unclean, and ſome of them are ſwift of wing; but they are not for ſacrifice. Thoughts are as ſwift as the birds of the air; they flie more ſpeedily, and thou canſt not hinder them from coming and hovering in thy mind: yet 'tis thy duty to keep them from building and neſting themſelves if they be of an unclean kind. If thou canſt keep evil and vain thoughts out from getting entrance, thou ſhalt quit thy ſelf like a man: but if they break in upon thee, gather thy ſtrength to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſtrive to beat them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. If men did begin betimes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter combat with their ſins, whilſt they are but thoughts; how many wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes would be prevented upon the knees? many of Satans temptations would be taken up, and waſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which ſuffered to grow into actions, become ſtrong and ſpreading wickedneſſe. Friends, ſet your ſelves in oppoſition againſt the evil of your thoughts: this is the way to be more than Conquerors. Know this, he that thinks to waſte groſſe ſins which waſte the peace of his ſoul, muſt begin to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95743:38"/> fight them within dores, even in his own thoughts, but he that thinks to beat ſin out of action, and leaves it in his thoughts, begins at the wrong end; it is an eaſie thing for ſin to paſſe from the thought into action: <q rend="inline">he that cuts off this paſſage, may be ſecure of this converſation outwardly:</q> if therefore thou meet with any evil thoughts within thee, declare thy ſelf an enemy, and caſt them out.</p>
                     <p>A fourth general Remedy againſt evil thoughts, is: Have reſpect unto Gods word; he that would hedge out evil thoughts, muſt look into Gods word: this is it which ſets bounds to all vain thoughts; the Pſalmiſt propounds a queſtion: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>how may a young man cleanſe his way,</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9.<bibl>Pſal. 119. 9</bibl> a hard matter for any man, but more hard in a young man, who by reaſon of his perturbation and violence of affections, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers accounted unfit for their Schools, yet the means is preſcribed by taking heed, according to thy word: the word of God gives wiſdom unto the ſimple, if they will hear it, and give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereunto; if the law of God be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95743:38"/> in a mans heart, none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide:<bibl>Pſal. 37. 31.</bibl> men may account the word of God a weak defence and ſhelter againſt any annoyance: but hear what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it, from experience: the weapons of our warfare, are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down imaginations, <bibl>2 Cor. 10. 4, 5.</bibl> (mark that) and every high thing that exalts it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought to the obedience of Chriſt: high imaginations fall down before the word, and before it every thought goeth into captivity.</p>
                     <p>The fifth general remedy againſt vain and wicked thoughts, is prayer; pray againſt evill thoughts. This is a general remedy againſt all evills, and we have need to make uſe of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the exorbitances of our thoughts, becauſe they are ſo continually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring forth ſin: the body grows weary in acting thoſe ſins, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a concurrency of the members of the body, but the mind is never without its contemplative wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95743:39"/> in one kind, or other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we alwayes ſtand in need of prayer, to help thoſe weakneſſes of our thoughts: if a clock be not every day wound up, it will ſtand, and not tell you the time of the day; and ſo will our thoughts fall upon lower and looſer objects, unleſſe they be pullyed and lifted up unto God by prayer: the Apoſtle therefore bids us to pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually;<bibl>1 Theſ. 5. 17.</bibl> not that we ſhould do nothing elſe, (for the life of a Chriſtian is a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie life, and full of variety of work) but that in all our buſineſſe, the thoughts of our hearts ſhould have their ſhort ejaculations, and quick prayers unto God, which hinder not, but forward us in our labours with better ſucceſſe: the mind of man is of that ſpeed in actions, that the body cannot keep pace with it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all our bodily labours, gaine time to diſpatch a ſpeedy prayer unto God: but morning and evening do more eſpecially require our prayers unto God, that God being firſt in our thoughts in the morning, may barre out all vain thoughts from entring in

Bring your unruly and untruſty thoughts, like unfaithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants into the preſence of God; it may be, and it uſually happens, that an evil ſervant hath private haunts to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters dammage, yet in the eye of his Maſter, he will behave himſelf demure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and orderly; though <hi>Abſolom</hi> have a traiterous heart, and ambitious plot upon his Fathers kingdom: yet in the preſence of his Father, he will carry himſelf as one of the Kings ſons.

                     <p>Do not think within thy heart, Tuſh, God ſeeth not; there is no impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Gods omniſciencie, his eye is brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Sun, and breaketh into the moſt ſecret corners of thy cogitations, it's a Sun above thy head, which never ſets; a Candle in a room which never goes out: God can no more be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a perpetual view of our thoughts, then from his own immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable infiniteneſſe. Wherefore think thy ſelf continually in the preſence of God, and be not blind like <hi>Balaam,</hi> whoſe aſſe was more quick-ſighted, to ſee God, then himſelf: the ſoul which apprehends God looking upon him, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe moved by ſenſuality, to think God like unto himſelf) will ſtand in awe, and not ſin: the preſence of God is like Sun, and wind that ſcatters all the fogs of evil, and corrupt thoughts that ariſe. This ſtubble cannot endure the day of Gods coming. The Prophet when he bringeth in the Atheiſt, with a heart ſet within him to do wickedly, renders a reaſon out of his own mouth, ſaying; Tuſh, God ſeeth not, how doth God

                     <p> 7. Remedy againſt evil thoughts is, ſearch thine own conſcience, for the evil thoughts and purpoſes of thy life, which are paſſed: what is written there? how readeſt thou? what hath been the iſſue of ſuch thoughts, what ſucceſſe haſt thou had from them? have not evil thoughts drawn thee in to ſinne againſt God, to injure men, to defile thine own body? <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>what fruit hadſt thou in thoſe things whereof thou art now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?</hi>
                        </q> ſuppoſe God had not kept thy ſins from the eare of the world, what a confounded creature hadſt thou been: how aſhamed to look men in the face? if God had not remitted them in the cenſure of his own juſtice, and given thee ſome hope of forgiveneſſe, what a wretched man hadſt thou been? what feares and horrours had been upon thy ſoul? or what if thoſe ſins be forgiven thee: think what it coſt thee to ſue out thy pardon, and to get Gods ſeal upon thy conſcience; what if here thou ſhalt make inqueſt after thy Maſter-ſin, and conſider how evil thoughts have made their way into thy practice; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how often, how upon ſlight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95743:42"/> how after many vowes made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to the contrary, thou haſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly, ſcandalouſly, cowardly, and filthily yielded up thy ſelf as a vaſſail upon baſe conditions to think and do wickedly.</p>
                     <p>Let a man always carry this remedy with him as an Antidote in his pocket, and hang it upon the file of his heart, and when evil motions at any time begin to creep into the mind, then caſt this buſh in the way, which will ſo aſtoniſh the preſent working of our thoughts, that it will either confound them, or turn their courſe into ſome better chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. It were a happy thing, if we could thus make a vertue out of a vice, and turn that ſin into a remedy, againſt evil thoughts, which it ſelf had not been a ſin upon the file of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but that evil thoughts conceived it, and brought it forth. Some apply this receipt againſt the incurſion of proud thoughts, againſt the breaking in of heady and heedleſſe paſſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the breaking out of luſt, revenge, &amp;c. I commend it unto every Chriſtian as a ſudden remedy againſt all evil
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95743:42"/> thoughts: a ſubject it is, whereabout if a mind be ſeriouſly buſied, it will give him little joy to think ill or idly: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this with a <hi>Probatum eſt,</hi> as the remembrance of ſome one monſtrous ſin not forgiven, is inſupportable to a wicked man: ſo the remembrance of a foul thought, or other ſinne, though pardoned through Gods mercy, is very profitable to a righteous man, to keep him from evil thoughts, and to make his thoughts juſt.</p>

                     <p>I Have hitherto diſcovered General Remedies againſt the errours and wickedneſſe of mens thoughts: Let me now preſcribe ſome particular helps to be uſed againſt the ſeveral mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>And firſt againſt that errour of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deadned drowſineſſe, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughtfulneſſe of the mind before mentioned, the remedy will be: after due obſervation and mourning for the ſame; that the Righteous man do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep himſelfe, and his thoughts in ſome bodily or mental em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: and if that be within the compaſſe of his Calling, it will be the more prevailing remedy: ſo when ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are idle, wiſe Maſters ſet them their taskes, and hold them to their works, out of reſpect to their own profit, and their ſervants good. So
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95743:43"/> wiſer Parents buy their children Horn-books, and ſend them to ſchool; not ſo much to learn, as to keep them from harrnes, while they have nothing elſe to do. It fares ſo with our minds, like wandering children, or worthleſſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they will do nothing, or (which is worſe) ſhrewdly, unleſſe they be held to employments. It had been better with that ſweet Singer of Iſrael, if he had been imployed in Kingly affairs like himſelf, when his eye deceived his heart to follow filthy luſts. <q rend="inline">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>would not have younger widows received to miniſter as widows in the Church, to lodge ſtrangers, and to waſh the Diſciples feet,</hi> as their manner was, <hi>leſt they learn to be idle, and wander about, become tatlers, and buſie-bodies.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <bibl>1 Tim. 5. 13.</bibl> Idleneſſe, or that which is worſe, creeps into the practiſe of thoſe that are not well, or fitly employed: ſo it doth upon the mind. Standing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will puddle, and the mind not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſtands, and breeds verminous and evil thoughts. We make draines to cleanſe ſtanding waters, if we mean to keep them wholeſome; and we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95743:44"/> muſt find iſſues for our thoughts about ſome bodily or mental labour, if we mean to keep them juſt, as the thoughts of the Righteous are:</p>
                     <p>And that ye may the rather make uſe of this Remedy againſt idle thoughts, Conſider:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is againſt the nature of mans mind to be out of action: in ſleep the ſenſes both outward and inward are bound up: yet even then, the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie hath her dreams of actions. The heart of the Spouſe was awake while ſhe ſlept: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>I ſleep, but my heart wakes:</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <bibl>Cant. 5. 2.</bibl> So in the very drowſineſſe and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Righteous ſoul, all is not, all his thoughts ought not, to be bound up: there are, or ought to be, ſome excurrencies of the thoughts to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The body not employed, grows reſty, and carries on the man headlong, not onely to that which is beſides, but alſo to that which is contrary to the courſe of goodneſſe. Idleneſſe is the hour of temptation, wherein Satan joynes with our imagination to plot or attempt the production of ſome, or much miſchief.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:95743:44"/> 3. Employment and action hath the promiſe: This is the warrantable way wherein ſo long as the mind is found walking, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>the labour thereof ſhall not be in vain.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>It is the Righteous mans portion to enjoy the good of all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which he taketh under the Sun:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>1 Cor. 15. Eccleſ. 5. 18.</bibl> So then, if ye reſpect the nature of the mind, which is alwayes in action, or the diſpoſition of the body not employed, or the bleſſing of God over both, while they are in action according to his will, ye cannot but make uſe of this Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the cureing of the minds idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>But before I paſſe from hence, I muſt admoniſh, that thoughts employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout bodily labour, is not enough, nor all: there are employments of our thoughts which are more mental, and almoſt abſtracted from the body, and theſe are very needful: ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and meditation of heaven and heavenly things: a ſoul thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, whether he be in the body, or out of the body he cannot tell: ſuch a neighbourhood or indiſtance he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends betwixt God and his mind.</p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:95743:45"/>
                     <p> Again, I admoniſh that labour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be about bodily things, or ſuch as are more the work of the mind; yet it muſt be about that which is good, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the remedy may be worſe than the diſeaſe. Its better, ſaith our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, to be idle, than ill employed. The Apoſtle would <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>that every one ſhould labour, but he that labours bodily, muſt labour the thing that is honeſt:</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>and he that labours with the mind muſt ſtudy to ſhew himſelf approved unto God, a workman that need not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Further, I admoniſh, that your thoughts be employed about thoſe things eſpecially which are within your Callings: he that moves in his Calling, though but ſlowly, though not ſo faſt as others, ſhall in the end find comfort: But I cannot hope to gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thiſtles: Every tree muſt bring forth his own fruit; the Magiſtrate hath his thoughts, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter his, and the honeſt Husbandman and Tradeſman theirs.</p>
                     <p>Once more I admoniſh, that your thoughts of employment, be in ſuch

                     <p>I Shall ſtay no longer upon this Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt idle and ſleepy thoughts: by urging to bodily or mental imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The next errour of thoughts (as I have obſerved) to be remedied, falls in here, which is a lightneſſe or vanity of our thoughts, in buſying themſelves upon vain objects: ſuch as old wives fables, fictions of Poets, nothings, or things that are nothing worth.</p>
                     <p>The Remedy is, to chooſe out reall and better things for imagination to work upon: for as are the thoughts, ſo is the man. The body grows into likeneſſe with thoſe things whereon it uſually feeds: So do ſouls into ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude with thoſe things which the imagination daily thinks upon: that man muſt needs be a vain man, whoſe ſtudies and cogitations are vaine:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95743:46"/> Wherefore as he that would expel wind out of the ſtomack, muſt feed upon ſome wholeſome nouriſhment, which hath vertue in it to expel wind: So he that would expel windy phanſies out of his mind, muſt propound to his conſideration ſome ſerious truths wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Chriſtian thoughts. In this caſe, ſome have thought meet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our conſideration thoſe <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor noviſſima,</hi> Death, the day of Judgement, the joyes of Heaven, and the torments of Hell, to remedy our vain imaginations; and doubtleſſe, thoughts upon ſuch ſerious truths as theſe, would take off our minds from vain things. What if I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to think upon the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, the love of Chriſt, the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt? What if I ſhould entreat you to think upon thoſe great works of God, Creation, Providence, Redemption, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Preparation and Donation of the Kingdom of Heaven? Would not the thoughts of theſe things force out of your minds, the thoughts of ſtrange gods, ſtrange religions and worſhip?
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95743:47"/> What ſhould the thoughts of heathen gods, as <hi>Baal, Moloch,</hi> or <hi>Aſhtoreth</hi> do among theſe: what ſhould Chriſtians ſtudy Romances, Playes, Interludes, Faſhions, vain hiſtories, who have Bibles to look into, and the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſalvation to ſtudy, and the duties of Religion to learn and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: hear the Apoſtles advice,<bibl>Phil. 4. 8.</bibl> and receive it as an Antidote againſt all vain imaginations: whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report: if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things: all things that are true, and honeſt; and juſt, and pure, and lovely, and of good report: vertuous, or praiſe-worthy, are objects of a righteous mans juſt thoughts.</p>
                     <p>The next vanity of our thoughts to be remedied, is the unſtaiedneſſe, or wandrings of the mind, whereby theſe actions of the mind are unſetled, and whirling from one thing to another without any certainty, like men that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95743:47"/> ſhoot their arrowes at rovers. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy hereof is to fix the mind upon that which is good; when the things we think of are meet for meditations, and contemplative thoughts, the ſoul muſt make a ſtay upon them: it is true, that too much poreing upon one thing, puts our meditations and inventions upon impertinencies, and barrenneſſe, but light and ſhort thoughts vaniſh into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and never produce good effects: this vanity is not ſo eaſily perceived in things natural or civil, as it is when the mind is about things divine; as prayer, hearing of the word of God, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereon, receiving the ſacraments. In theſe things it is moſt difficult to keep to the point, or ſtand at the mark; both by reaſon of Satans cunning and craft, and the ungainneſs and indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind unto the buſineſſe, therefore let the wiſe Chriſtian ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fix his thoughts upon ſpiritual occaſions. So when the Pſalmiſt was purpoſed to ſing and give thanks, he ſaith, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>My heart is fixed oh God, my heart is fixed:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Pſal. 57. 7.</bibl> Many heard the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds relating what was told them by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95743:48"/> the Angel concerning the Babe Chriſt; and they wondred at the words that were told them, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>but Mary kept all theſe things, and pondered them in her heart:</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <bibl>Luke 2. 18, 19.</bibl> it is not enough to wonder at Gods words and works, we muſt let him have ſome reaſonable time to ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our minds, that they make impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: tranſient views, and haſty ſights of things that paſſe by, leave no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or faſhion of things upon the eye, to transferre to the phantaſie; no more do our ſuddain and haſty thoughts of things, carry any true intelligence of them to the underſtanding, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, as they are to the will: the eye that ſeeth things truly, muſt be held to its object, and the mind that profits by things ſpiritual, muſt make a competent ſtay of the thoughts, upon the matter in hand.</p>
                     <p>And thus when a Chriſtian can in things divine reclaim the mind from wandrings in ſome meaſure, and keep his thoughts to the point, he ſhall by Gods grace prevent with eaſe this errour of unſtayedneſſe, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his calling: wherein theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runnings,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95743:48"/> of the thoughts are not ſo dangerous, nor ſo worthy obſervation.</p>
                     <p>Here let me put in a Caveat, while I labour to remedy the unſtayedneſſe of thoughts, I do not in any wiſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize a deadneſſe or drowſineſſe of mind, either in devotions, or in matters civil, I have condemned that as an errour already: living and active thoughts are needful in prayers, and all duties to God; and working imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations do more often produce honeſt and honourable actions among men: ſtayedneſſe of thoughts is not dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, but reſtraint laid upon their wildeneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The third vanity of thoughts is, when they are buſied, but to no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable end; many there are whoſe thoughts are wonderful buſie about the things they intend: yet all to no purpoſe. God is not honoured, the brethren are not edified, themſelves are no way nearer heaven for all their labours: and this vanity appears not only amongſt wicked, and worldly minded men, but alſo amongſt them that would ſeem to be religious, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95743:49"/> too often among them that are truly gracious: this may appear in the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and communions of the beſt men, and women, who account their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be good, if harmleſſe; though otherwiſe unprofitable for publick or private good: and if this fault through the cunning of Satan do creep ſo ſlyly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our outward communions, how much more into our inward cogitations: it is a vanity amongſt all kinds of people more or leſſe; to digge to themſelves Ciſterns, that hold no water, to ſow the wind, and to reap chaffe.</p>
                     <p>For the remedying of this evil of thoughts, look over and examine your thoughts how they look at Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the good of men, the benefit of thy own ſoul; whatſoever thoughts make not out towards one, or ſome, or all theſe ends, directly, or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, they are not juſt thoughts: here is much ſpiritual wiſdom requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that a man may ſee to the end of his thoughts, and know what profit is like to come in by them: the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er notes it,<bibl>Eccleſ. 2. 14.</bibl> 
                        <q rend="inline">

                        </q> ignorant and wicked men, follow their own imaginations, and as they that are in darkneſſe, they walk on, and know not where they ſhall fall, but a Righteous man turns again upon his own thoughts, and Queſtions, <hi>Cui bono?</hi> to what end are theſe thoughts within my heart? will they bring in any glory to God, any good to the Church, any peace or comfort to my ſelf, here or hereafter: if none away with them, why ſhould my unprofitable thoughts cauſe me to offend? if they will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God, and Religion, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to myſelf, and others: my heart ſhall ſtay upon them, and I will purſue the accompliſhment of them unto the end.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when thoughts ariſe in thy mind, examine them, whither they would, if they be bound for heaven let them go on, yet look to them, that they keep the way: for many ſet out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven in their morning thoughts, but loſe themſelves and their way before night; it will not be amiſſe oftentimes to demand of thy ſelf (whether in the riſings or progreſſions of thy thoughts) are theſe thoughts ſuch
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95743:50"/> as make for my ſalvation: ſhall I be of the ſame mind, hereafter as I am now: is God of my mind, is my opinion now according to the rule of Gods word: would I judge thus, think thus, be of this mind; if I were now to anſwer, and give up my laſt account unto Jeſus Chriſt, the righteous Judge of quick and dead, who will render unto every man according to the things done in the body: thoſe thoughts which wil not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this arraignment, ſuſpect them that they will prove unprofitable to thee in the end; and reſolve them into better.</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that charity thinks no evil,<bibl>1 Cor. 13 5</bibl> a righteous man is a charitable man, and therefore will not imagine or deviſe any thing that is unprofitable, or hurtful to his brother: the thoughts of the righteous are juſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deviſeth liberal things, for God, and for them that are Gods; his thoughts are juſt to God, giving him honour, juſt to man, giving to every man that which is his due: juſt to himſelf; not ſo much taking care<bibl>Mat. 6. 31. 33.</bibl>

                     </p>
                     <p>But here an admonitition may be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably put in (though by what hath been ſaid already; the judicious may take cognizance of it) which is, that righteous men muſt not think only how they may profit themſelves: he that thinks in his thoughts to pleaſe himſelf only, will not truly endeavour in his courſe to profit all men: in this caſe 'tis good advice,<bibl>Phil. 2. 4.</bibl> look not every one of his own things, but every one on the things of others: ſo the Apoſtle more purpoſely.<bibl>1 Cor. 10. 33.</bibl> I pleaſe all men in all things; not ſeeking mine own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>Again, let others be admoniſhed, that they do not think their endeavours and ſtudies to be unprofitable unleſſe they be ſingular, and above others of their own rank. Surely, if we would labour to know with ſobriety, we ſhould be more profitable to others, and leſſe troubleſome unto our ſelves: an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of ſingularity, is but the pride of a mans heart, and ſuch uſually to get applauſe for ſomething of rare inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95743:51"/> neglect the more profitable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their thoughts, about their calling.</p>
                     <p>And now we will proceed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a remedy to the fourth vanity of thoughts, which appears in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſorder.</p>
                     <p>The remedy muſt be to ſuit and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our thoughts according to our buſineſſe, with reſpect to time and place, and perſons, the imagination is infinitely fruitful: and to order all her conceptions, conſervations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ſeperations, creations of new ſpecies, productions of them into thoughts and propoſitions of them to the mind and will, would be a labour too buſie for me to meddle with, in this caſe I muſt leave the work to every judicious Chriſtian, to conſult with the rule of Gods word, according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies of his thoughts, yet I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive that this remedy preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed againſt the confuſion of thoughts, may be of much uſe and benefit.</p>
                     <p>Conſider then what is the buſineſſe thou art about, humane or divine; and let thy thoughts be compoſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95743:51"/> upon it: divine thoughts ſuit with divine works: and humane thoughts with humane buſineſſe, while all things are done to the glory of God: to this purpoſe, referre that of <hi>Salomon;</hi>
                        <bibl>Eccleſ. 9. 10.</bibl> whatſoever thy hand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do, do it with thy might.</p>
                     <p>Conſider the time, whether holy by divine appointment, by publick or private deſtination, or permitted to common labours of thy calling.</p>
                     <p>Let not Sabbaths and dayes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation be prophaned with common thoughts; holy thoughts are for holy Sabboths: thoughts of mourning are for dayes of faſting and prayer; thoughts of rejoycing in the Lord, for dayes of feaſting, and thankſgiving: and thoughts of thy calling, for dayes of work, and trading.</p>
                     <p>So for holy places and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, holy thoughts are ſuitable, and in all things which thou haſt to do, conſider thy own calling, and chiefly mind thine own buſineſſe,<bibl>2 Theſ. 3. 11.</bibl> a buſie body in other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is of no good report in the Scriptures; the thoughts of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95743:52"/> are as confuſed and diſorderly, as the buſineſſe of their lives; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what thou doſt, and what is meet for thee to do, in time and place, and I am perſwaded thy thoughts will be leſſe confuſed and more orderly.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                     <p>THus I have ſpoken of Remedies for the two firſt errours of thoughts (to wit) the dowſineſſe and vanity of them, in regard of object, in regard of unſtayedneſſe, in regard of unprofitableneſſe, and in regard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. I ſhall now alſo ſay ſomething for remedy againſt the wickedneſſe of thoughts, which happens when our thoughts draw in our affection and will to deſire, and like of wickedneſſe, and our minds to deviſe to bring it to paſſe. I will not here give the remedies to theſe two errours ſeverally, but toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at once. Expect not a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for every kind of wicked thoughts apart, as erroneous, heretical, covetous, ambitious, revengeful, proud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the objects of the affections are almoſt infinite, and the evil imaginations of the mind working toward the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95743:53"/> of wickedneſſe, are ſo various, who can know them? Yet ſomething I ſhall ſay to theſe; for it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the Reader, and I am bound to it by promiſe in this undertaking: Here again I muſt leave much for the judicious to do of themſelves in their own occurrencies of thoughts: Yet thus for a help unto them that are weak.</p>
                     <p>Have thy thoughts drawn in thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which is ſinful, and is thy mind plotting to accompliſh it? Firſt give ſtop to theſe wicked affections and deviſings at their firſt beginnings: <hi>Sero medicina paratur:</hi> Long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed diſeaſes are ſtubborne to yield unto medicine: an infant-thought may take a check; but if it grow man by continuance, all the wit and ſtrength thou haſt will hardly bow him back. The phanſie will take fire at a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before we be aware, like tinder, which kindles at the leaſt ſpark falling into it, and 'tis a mover as quick and ſpreading as fire. The lightning is not quicker than thought: we had need therefore to be ſpeedy in giving
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95743:53"/> ſtop to our wicked thoughts. <hi>Job</hi> knew this, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>and therefore made covenant with his eyes, not to think upon a maid.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <bibl>Job 31. 1.</bibl> What the eye ſeeth, or the eare hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the heart may deſire; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, undeſired. If it be poſſible keep wickedneſſe from the eye and eare; theſe are the two principal gates by which ſin enters into our hearts: if the watch were kept more ſtrictly at theſe gates, we ſhould not ſo often find our enemy within us. If <hi>David</hi> had looked better to his eyes, adultery had not gotten into his thought: nor could the whoriſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have come into the young mans heart, had he kept her out of his eares: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>it was with much fair ſpeeches that ſhe cauſed him to yield.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Prov. 7. 21</bibl> The eye and the eare, are the out-works of the ſoul: he that would keep out evil thoughts, muſt barricadoe theſe gates.</p>
                     <p>Let evil thoughts receive a check at their firſt offer to enter; for he that gives way to his imaginations, ſhews that he would give way to wicked actions, if they were as free from ſhame and puniſhment.</p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:95743:54"/>
                     <p> And a man may know much of his gratious ſtate by his own uſing of his thoughts: he that forbears evil, out of a conſcience of ſin, will forbear alſo to imagin evil in his heart: but men of corrupt minds, are not men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>2. If thou canſt not ſtop them in their beginnings, then thy care muſt be to divert them to ſome more profitable or pious object. When the water hath gotten in upon us, we make draines and water-courſes to carry it ſome other way: and ſo likewiſe muſt we do with our evil thoughts: if they have broken in upon us, we muſt turn them aſide to ſome other matter. As ſuppoſe, coveteous, or envious, or proud thoughts, be got into thy mind, thou mayeſt divert them to liberal, merciful, humble thoughts.<bibl>Joh. 4. 12.</bibl> The woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> was a great admirer of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well,<bibl>ver. 20.</bibl> and the mountain of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the one for water, and the other for the worſhip of God: Chriſt diverts her opinion of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well, by telling her of a Well of water ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up unto everlaſting life:<bibl>ver. 14.</bibl> and her
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95743:54"/> opinion of Gods worſhip in <hi>Samaria:</hi> by reſolving her that ſalvation is of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and diverting her to think of a worſhiping of God <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>in ſpirit and in truth.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>ver. 22, 23.</bibl> If I ſhould preſcribe one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the multitude of your evill thoughts to turn them unto: it ſhould be God, who is infinitely long and broad, and wide, beyond the extent of the ſouls deſires or thoughts: King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms cannot ſatisfie ambition; Gold as the duſt of the ſtreet cannot ſatisfie covetouſneſſe: pleaſures to ſatiety and loathing, content not the fleſh: and the mind is as unſatisfied with thinking and knowing; onely God is of that infiniteneſſe, and of that excellency that all thoughts and deſires, are terminated in him; and all thoughts and deſires that turn themſelves unto God, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by looking upon him.</p>
                     <p>3. If evil thoughts ſtill preſſe in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, if they will not be ſtop'd nor diverted, break them off with ſome violence; if they be unreaſonable and juſtle out better thoughts, lay hands upon them;<bibl>1 Cor. 9. 27.</bibl> if the body grow unruly, it muſt be kept under and brought
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95743:55"/> into ſubjection. Some thoughts are ſo wicked, that they will not be caſt out (like thoſe Devils) without faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer. If any thought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee ſhall croſſe Religion or reaſon, reſolve to croſſe it. There are ſome curſed imaginations which are the mother-roots of a multitude of ſins: as thoſe which move Queſtions ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of Gods Eſſence, Perſonality, Mercy, Juſtice, Power, Providence; and whether the Scriptures be the word of God: whether the ſouls of men be immortal; whether there be a Heaven or a Hell: ſuch thoughts as theſe ſhould not be diſputed withal, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe allowed, but expelled or kill'd: if but ſuch thoughts as theſe be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and allowed within, they will make a ſoul as deſolate of grace, as a City is without an inhabitant; he that hath no rule over his own ſpirit, (certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis true in this caſe) is like a City that is broken down, and without walls.<bibl>Prov. 25. 28.</bibl> I ſhall never marvel that he is a wicked man, whom I know to allow himſelf or others, in ſuch thoughts as theſe: but I ſhal think grace is ruined in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95743:55"/> that man, that diſputes theſe things, &amp; determines them againſt the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>4. If wicked thoughts will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone yet, thou haſt this remedy left: call in help againſt them: pray them away, pray God in to thy help againſt them: pray for a change of thine own nature, of thine own thoughts: Was not this the thing which <hi>David</hi> prayed for? <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Pſal. 51. 10.</bibl> 'Tis plain it was. Let us lift up our hearts in prayer againſt all our ſinnes in thoughts: but eſpecially againſt them that are wicked ones: heavy thoughts and vain thoughts are errours, and not excuſeable from ſin: but wicked thoughts are of a worſer generation, we muſt purge our ſelves from theſe with greater diligence: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>I know fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is bound up in the heart of a child, an evil heart cannot but think evil:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Prov. 22. 15.</bibl> What can I look for from an Adder but her poiſon and her ſting: yet we may pray out fooliſhneſs out of our hearts. And I believe <hi>Paul</hi> often uſed this help againſt the evils of his own heart; for he ſaith, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>When I was a child, I ſpake as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95743:56"/> a child, I underſtood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childiſh things.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>1 Cor. 13. 21.</bibl> It may be thou art a child in thy ſpeaking, in thy underſtanding, in thy thinking: pray that thou mayeſt become a man, and be able to put away childiſh things.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of the evil of thoughts, and how we may by Gods aſſiſtance, remedy the ſame. I beſeech you Brethren apply theſe remedies to the ſeverall errours of your thoughts, and they will doe you much good.</p>
                     <p>Object not an impoſſibility for any to remedy the infirmities and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of thoughts: what nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, grace may, and what man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, God can. Every Chriſtian who hath the ſpirit of God, is enabled by that ſpirit within him, to do all things Evangelically, or with a Goſpel allowance, whereunto he is called of God. If God would have the thoughts of a righteous man to be juſt, God hath not made it an impoſſible work: what
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95743:56"/> nature within thee is averſe to do, and what grace within thee cannot do, that the ſpirit within thee can do, and the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee hath done: wherefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair not of the work, but go about it.</p>

                        <bibl>Jer. 3. 17.</bibl> When God makes the Church his Throne and the Nations gather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, to worſhip the Lord, then ſhall they leave off their wicked thoughts, and walk no more after them. We live in theſe happy times of the Goſpel, wherein, though every one hath not Eagles eyes, yet he may ſee a glorious light riſen and ſhining, (though through ſome clouds.) I ſuppoſe in former times ſuch ſtrict obſervance of our thoughts might have been ſlacked with leſſe ſin, than now; for God winked at thoſe dayes of ignorance: but now, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes for evil thoughts are as unplead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as for evil deeds. If now we walk in an evil way, in a way that is not good, after our evil thoughts, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>God that ſpreads out his hands unto a rebellious people all the day long:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Iſa. 65. 2.</bibl> will ſtretch out his arme againſt a wicked people to puniſh them, becauſe they will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to amendment; for they that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95743:58"/> will not be perſwaded to rectiſie their thoughts, by the actions of Gods hand, ſhall be confounded at the laſt by the force of his arm.</p>
                     <p>And now we are come to the Point: where we ſhall firſt declare the means how we may attain good thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſouls: and after that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. All that hath been written hitherto, may be referred hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And therefore where I ſhall have occaſion to fall upon the ſame things again, I ſhall either paſſe them over briefly, or enlarge them with variety, to avoid tediouſneſſe, and nauſeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from the Reader.</p>
                     <p>1. For the getting of good thoughts into thy mind, it is needful that thou cleanſe the mind of all vain, and evil, and drowſie thoughts, ſo much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly thou canſt: he that would have good thoughts like the pillars of fire and ſmoke, to lead his actions day and night in this dangerous wilderneſſe, muſt in ſome meaſure cleanſe the heart of its native corruption, and of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted foulneſſe: for as we have no reaſon to expect ſweet liquor out of a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95743:59"/> fuſty veſſel, or good water out of a bitter fountain; figs from thorns, or grapes from thiſtles: ſo we have as ſmall ground to expect that an unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and unchanged heart, ſhould ſend forth a current of clean and purified thoughts. <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>The good man out of the good treaſure of his heart brings forth good things, and the wicked man out of the evil treaſure of his heart brings forth evil things:</hi>
                        </q> ſo all fruits are of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the tree whereon they grow. Our Saviour, who knew how to refer every effect to his proper cauſe, doth affirm, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>That out of the heart cometh thoughts of Murder, Adultery, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſins of all ſorts:</hi>
                        </q> For the heart is evil above meaſure, and caſts into the thoughts continually that poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which either makes them black as Hell, or muddles them with mire and dirt of fearful perplexities, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore as many as intend to get good thoughts into their minds; let them give all diligence that the heart be cleanſed from all evil ones.</p>

                     <p> But here I admoniſh him that will ſet upon this work, that it is a work of more difficulty than many account it, not ſo ſoon done, as thought on. 'Tis not a few ſighs, and ſuperficial groans: 'tis not a few proverbial notions: nor yet the ſubduing of ſome notorious ſin, which is puniſhable and ſhameful in the world; but a total and univerſal change of all the faculties and powers of the ſoul: It is in the words of the Apoſtle, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>A putting off concerning the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the old man which is corrupt according to the deceiveable luſts, and a renovation in the ſpirit of our minds, by putting on that new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

                        <bibl>Eph. 4. 22, 23, 24.</bibl> And though we cannot attain the full meaſure and furtheſt degree of this cleanſing at the firſt, nor yet feel ſuch a ſenſible apprehenſion of the ſame as we deſire; yet let us not give over endeavours, nor be diſcomforted and diſquieted in our ſouls, if God give us a firſt-fruits, he will in time give us a harveſt.<bibl>Jam. 5. 7.</bibl>

                        </q> and if we be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and ſtabliſh our hearts, God will give unto us hearts cleanſed in ſome meaſure of all filthy thoughts. In this caſe we are not without a promiſe: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>After thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi>

                        <bibl>Jer. 31. 33.</bibl> And if we be once made maſters of ſome good thoughts, God will make us maſters over more; for him whom God finds faithful over a few things, he will make Lord over many things: and to him that hath, it ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</p>
                     <p>If any would know how to cleanſe and purifie the heart, he may conſult Authors purpoſely written upon that Subject. There are Treatiſes written thereof for more ample ſatisfaction: wherein he ſhal find, that God ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in his firſt appearance to the ſoul uſeth the outward miniſtery of the Word, and by his Spirit inwardly, gives and applies that which is ſpoken unto the heart of the hearer, whereby the heart ſees its own corruption and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and thereupon loaths and abhors
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95743:60"/> it ſelf, and as a ſtomack ſurfeited with evil humours, would willingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge it ſelf, ſo it deſires to be delivered of its ſin, and eaſed of its miſery. Then hearing and attending to the Promiſes of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives hope by Chriſt, that new and living way: not onely to be diſcharged of ſin and miſery; but alſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour with God: and then lies groaning at the foot-ſtoole of grace, till God come in by his Spirit, and ſay, unto the poor ſoul, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>I am thy ſalvation:</hi>
                        </q> and thereupon it believes and purifies the heart of all noxious thoughts, words, and actions, and beholding Chriſt in the glaſſe of Gods Word, <q rend="inline">

                        <bibl>2 Cor. 3. 18.</bibl> but this briefly; becauſe I would not make too large an excurſion (if yet it be one) out of my way.</p>
                     <p>2. He that would have good thoughts in his mind, let him attend the means of grace in Gods ſeveral diſpenſations: let him give up his heart unto that <hi>form of Doctrine which hath been delivered unto the Saints:</hi> and ſubject his ſoul
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95743:61"/> in all humility unto the whole will of God revealed, and openly urged (by ſuch as are ſent) upon his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wil, and affections, in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Preaching; which being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed, <hi>is the power of God unto ſalvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I muſt admoniſh them that hear the Word of God, that they would be patients, to take what God preſcribes for the cure of their thoughts. That man wil never make a good Diſciple, and follower of Chriſt, that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deny himſelf; a novice that is proud, is not far from the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil. <hi>Naaman</hi> had almoſt loſt the cure of his Leproſie, by deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his own Rivers of <hi>Abanah</hi> and <hi>Parphar.</hi> We muſt not quarrel at Gods way or method of cureing our thoughts, nor at the perſons of Gods ſending, to adminiſter ſpiritual help unto us.

He that would have good thoughts, let him pray: let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Lord to enrich his ſoul by his ſanctifying ſpirit; for by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed acts, the ſpirit doth renew our minds. God ſaves us, but not by works of Righteouſneſſe, which we have done, but according to his mercy by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt: <q rend="inline">pray for that, therefore, that ye may be waſed and ſaved.</q>

                     <p>The fourth meanes to get good thoughts into thy mind, is to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Gods Saints, be thou as much as conveniently, and without prejudice of thy calling in the company of them that are godly, whoſe communion will edge the good motions that are upon thy ſpirit, as Iron ſharpens Iron.<bibl>2 Pet. 3. 1.</bibl> 
                        <hi>Peters</hi> Epiſtles had power in them to ſtirre up the pure minds of holy men; there is a power alſo in the interloquutories and familiar conferences of holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when they meet face to face; <hi>Paul</hi> had a great deſire of many years, to ſee (not ſo much the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in her then glory) as the brethren at

                        <hi>Rome,</hi>
                        <bibl>Rom. 15. 23, 24.</bibl> that he might be filled with their company, we believe a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, and ſhall we not deſire to be aſſiſtants one to another, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and receive ſome ſpiritual gifts, interchangeably? God himſelf is ſeen in the congregations of holy men, and therefore as <hi>Manoah</hi> and his wife, when they had ſeen an Angel, thought they had ſeen the face of God. So when we ſhall ſee the face of Gods people, let us think we behold the face of God in them, for they are the livelieſt pictures of Gods image, their converſation will adminiſter thoughts of imitation, their conferences will ſeaſon our unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory meditations, their diſcourſe will draw out waters of life, ſo that we may perceive the deep things of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, flowing out of their bellies unto us: and though Satan in the company of wicked men, do beget upon their imaginations, a company of wicked thoughts, yet the ſpirit of God is as plentiful in producing good motions in godly minds by the company of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied men: do but obſerve the iſſues of thy mind after thy fill of their company,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95743:62"/> how barren doſt thou return from the tables of thoſe, where thou haſt not ſeen the face of God, nor heard any talk of heaven, and if amongſt them, Satan have but whiſtled an horn-pipe, how is thy ſoul dulled or grieved, or turned out of the way; or unfitted for heavenly thoughts. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when thou haſt been praying, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, mourning, or it may be feaſting with Gods Saints, how cheerful will the ſoul be? it ſeems to have fed upon ſome diſh (like <hi>Elijahs</hi> meat) in the ſtrength whereof thy thoughts goe a long journey in holy meditations, therefore be ſure of a holy man to thy friend, and the more the better; and make much account of him or them, it's a wonder to ſee what force is in the company of godly men, to ſtirre up good thoughts: and lamentable to ſee how Satan ſtrangles good thoughts in ſome, when they are ready to appeare in action by evill company, ſo that thoſe thoughts never live to ſee the light.</p>
                     <p>5. He that would get good thoughts, and ſtore his heart with them, muſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95743:63"/> make much of them, when they come: they are quick movers, they come ſuddenly, and they are gone as ſoon; if they be not kindly entertained: they will not ſtay long at the dore knocking, nor ſcraping for acquaintance, they are the meſſengers of Gods Spirit, and they bring good newes to the ſoul that bids them welcom, but the non-entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, or the ſlight entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, is a grieving of the holy Spirit of God, that ſent them. If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> meſſengers be unkindly entreated by <hi>Nabal,</hi> or frowned upon, they will back to their Lord, and acquaint him with their uſage, and do not thou think but. thy carriage towards holy thoughts will be carried to Gods ear: But if thou give kind entertainment to good thoughts, they will ſtay with thee, to counſell and comfort thee; and they will bring with them home to thine heart, many more of their own kind to lodge with thee: for God himſelf will ſend them in plentiful manner, who loves to furniſh ſuch an hoſt with the beſt commers. Good thoughts in this reſpect are ſomething like unto riches,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95743:63"/> they come to them in moſt plenty, who eſteem them moſt: the world muſt be courted, and gracious thoughts muſt be much made of,</p>
                     <p>And conſider, good thoughts are worthy entertainment, they are to be reckoned amongſt our better friends, a man can hardly make too much of them:<bibl>Pſ.</bibl> in the multitude of theſe thoughts, the comforts of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Make much of them, for firſt they are good in themſelves, the births of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious minds begotten upon them by the Spirit of God, for we are not able of our ſelves to think a good thought.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, theſe have been kind to us, and done us many a good turn, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe our ſolitary nights, and tedious houres of ſickneſſe, impriſonment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, travailes from place to place, while no comforters have been our companions, but God and our good thoughts. We may ſay with <q rend="inline">

                     <p>Thirdly, our good thoughts are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do us good hereafter, and it may be at ſuch a time, when we ſhall have more need of them, then ever we have had yet; it was <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his ſickneſſe, to think how he had walked before God, in truth, and with a perfect heart, and he beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord alſo, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him in this behalf:<bibl>2 Kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Make much of good thoughts, they will ſeaſon the rooms where they come, and make the heart the houſe of God: But here a word of admonition to them that have not good thoughts, or rather to them whoſe good thoughts make of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of departure. Suſpect (beloved) your entertainments of them have been harſh, or diſtaſtful: uſe them more kindly, entreat their ſtay, offer them violence, keep them by force, (if it be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95743:64"/> poſſible) that they go not over the threſhold from you. Imitate herein <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> bold wreſtling with God; hold them faſt, let them not go, leſt ye loſe a bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>6. He that would get good thoughts into his mind, muſt have a great care to keep his mind off from evil objects, wicked perſons, places of iniquity, things that are ſinfull in themſelves, or occaſionally; for though wicked men make no matter to offer themſelves to theſe temptations, as nakedly as mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men run into the tents of their enemies: yet the children of God who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved what foyles other men, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have formerly received by ſuch fool-hardines, wil wiſely keep themſelvs at a diſtance; this made him pray, <q rend="inline">

                        </q> he that hath no care in this caſe, may find great diſorders creep into his thoughts, before he be aware.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the nature of imagination to receive the ſpecies or ſhapes of things from the outward ſenſes, and laying of them up a while, till ſhe hath judged of them; then to report them to the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95743:65"/> underſtanding: and from what ſhe hath received, ſhe can alſo create new ſpecies, and non-entities, of which kind are the uſual fictions of Poets: it behoves a man therefore to take heed with what objects, or matters, he hath to do, leſt by them ſomething get into the mind to diſorder and diſſettle the government of his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoughts, or being themſelves in poſſeſſion, keep out better things then themſelves from entring; keep off therefore from things that are in themſelves ſimply unwarrantable, and from thoſe alſo which are ſuch by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and circumſtantially, as were thoſe things whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Idols Temples, and meat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed unto Idols.</p>
                     <p>Why? but <hi>Paul</hi> doth not condemn ſuch things as unlawful, but notes them indifferent true; but to him that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his own mind, not to him that doubts: to him that walks in charity, not to him that gives an offence to a weak brother, for whom Chriſt died.</p>
                     <p>Why? but it is lawful to make ſin it ſelf the object of our thoughts, we may
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95743:65"/> think of it: we may think of <hi>Adams</hi> ſins, of our own ſins; we may think of the miſery of man by ſin, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from whence we are fallen: what was our purity of nature, our proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Paradiſe, and what Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance we had from God in that ſtate, and how ſin hath now taken up the room wherein God kept; and curſes have ſucceeded in the ſtead of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: alas, our caſe is now ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, that we have not a labour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearineſſe, a pleaſure without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety, or pain; a meat without poyſon, a way without a Serpent, a friend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weakneſſe: theſe things we may think of, elſe why are we called upon to repent our ſelves of our ſins, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them, to pray pardon for them: to walk humbly, and to fear, becauſe of the terrours of the Lord. Yea further we may think of the workings of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan againſt us, with what trains and ſubtilties he ſeeks to entrap and enſnare us, that he may bring us to deſtruction, both of bodies and ſoules, whiles our fleſh confederates with him againſt us, like a kingdome divided in it ſelf:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95743:66"/> and the world conſpires with both, by frowns and favours to ſeparate us from God: Elſe why are we ſo often called upon, to beware of the wiles of the Devil, to ſubdue our own fleſh, to take heed of the world, leſt our hearts be pierced through with many ſorrows: and if ſo, What need is there to have a care to keep our minds from evil objects?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, 'tis lawful to think of our own ſins, of the malice of the Devil, of our own miſeries, of the deceitfulneſſe of the world, and of our own fleſh: while the thoughts of theſe things convey them ſo to the underſtanding, that it diſproves them, to the will that it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors them ſo far as they are evil; and thereupon ſet our hearts upon thoughts of mortification: but if the thought of theſe things ſhal draw in the wil to like of them, and the underſtanding to plot a forwarding of ſuch wickedneſſe as theſe propound, then the thinking upon theſe things, become evil thoughts. And thus we muſt have a great care to keep our minds from evil objects: leſt too much poreing upon
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95743:66"/> them, do ſecretly and cloſely conveigh ſome of their malignity into our minds and affections. Wherefore think not of ſin, but to loath it, think not of the Devil, but to reſiſt him, think not of thy fleſh, but to ſubdue: nor of the world, but to hate it ſo far as the love of it is enmity againſt God: But take off every thought concerning theſe things which draw in the wil to like, or the underſtanding to deviſe, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                     <p>7. That ye may get good thoughts into your minds, propound ſomething of worth and uſefulneſſe to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. Imagination will create and multiply good thoughts from a ſubjectof worth and excellency: and here thou mayeſt take up into thy thoughts the four Cardinal Workes of God. Firſt the Creation is a uſeful ſubject to think of: the matter out of which all things made their appearance at the firſt was nothing: the power by which God wrought them, was a word: the variety of creatures produced, were all things in Heaven above, in the Earth beneath, or in the Waters under the

                        </q> Paſſe hence to the wonder of mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when thou lookeſt into the myſtery hereof: leave off thy marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the frame and furniture of the World, the Sun, the Moon, and Stars, which he hath made: What wonder I at the Leviathans greatneſſe, taking his pleaſure in the Deep, or at the ſmal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the Wren and Piſmire? all theſe things are light in compariſon when I think of God, made Man, and deſcending from Heaven in the Son, a Babe born of a Virgin, ſwadled and laid in a manger: proclaimed by Angels, yet ſpitefully uſed by his creatures: dying and lying in the grave, and from thence riſing again, and aſcending back into Heaven from whence he deſcended before: This the Apoſtle commends unto us in the Goſpel,<bibl>1 Tim.</bibl> and calls it, <q rend="inline">

Any of Gods works of providence may ſweeten the labours of the longeſt day: and ſhorten the tediouſneſſe of the longeſt night: Even Gods ſpecial care of thy particular ſelf, in the ſeveral ages of thy life, when ſeriouſly thought upon, is no leſſe than wonderful; How many dangers of thy childhood, of thy youth, of thy age, hath God diſcovered unto thee? and ſometimes prevented them, ſometimes carried thee through them, and yet delivered thee from them? How many mercies hath he prepared and performed for thee, which never came into thy mind? Or if thou wilt, Conſider that gratious work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whereby the Spirit of God which breaths where it liſteth, takes up a poor creature already dead in ſins and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95743:68"/> treſpaſſes, and breaths into him the breath of Life, ſets him on his feet, and teacheth him to go, and holds him by his arm, that he ſhould henceforth fall no more for ever. I do but ſhew you ſome things of worth and uſefulneſſe to think upon: not to conſine a larger ſoul to theſe ſubjects onely. I know every particular work of God carries wonder in it: yet if thy ſoul do but climb, like promonts, to theſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, thy underſtanding will have ſo much in view, that thy thoughts need never be idle, nor ill employed: but find a matter to raiſe a good thought upon, and to multiply invention.

                     <p>I Forbear further rules for getting good thoughts, and ſhal now ſpeak of the rules more particularly whereby we muſt govern good thoughts once gotten. If it be expected by any, that I ſhould have been moſt large, or onely, upon this point, for the right govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a juſt mans thoughts. Let it alſo be conſidered, that all that hath been hitherto written, hath been but dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the ſame purpoſe. He that would govern his thoughts aright, muſt know not onely how to rule them being gotten, but how to remove hindrances of them; which I have done by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the evils of thoughts, and the remedies thereof, general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. He muſt alſo know how to get good thoughts, which I have done, by directing means for that purpoſe; and therefore when I have alſo given you
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95743:69"/> rules for the governing of your good thoughts being gotten, I ſhal think I have diſcharged my duty in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, according to the meaſure of the gift of God beſtowed upon me, for the edifying of his Church.</p>
                     <p>And that I may ſtir up your pure minds to this great Work of governing your good thoughts being gotten, Conſider:</p>
                     <p>1. Its honourable and praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, for a man to govern his own thoughts well: It was <hi>Salomons</hi> praiſe, that when God bid him ask and have: that leaving out riches, and long life, and honour, out of his petition, as things leſſe deſireable, he did earneſtly deſire, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Lord give thy ſervant an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding heart to judge thy people.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>1 Kin. 3. 9</bibl> It is no leſſe praiſeable in a Chriſtian being made a king over a ſtate as diſordered, as people, as mutinous, <hi>viz.</hi> his thoughts, and having the ſame promiſe which <hi>Salomon</hi> had, to ask and receive, and particulary to ask wiſdom of God who gives it,<bibl>Jam. 8.</bibl> if he beg of God that wiſdom which is from above, whereby his heart may be guided to ſettle his diſordered
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95743:70"/> (if not rebellious) thoughts in peace and ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>Certainly 'tis a work of great wiſdom to govern our thoughts aright, and if they be accounted wiſe who helped by power and cunning, can rule a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude well; they are alſo to be reputed wiſe, who can rule their own thoughts, which are a great people for number, and as apt to mutiny as men are: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch who rule well within, are to be accounted worthy of double honour, as they that rule well without.</p>
                     <p>Further, when we conſider the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of governing thoughts well, we muſt needs think them worthy praiſe, who can do it: ſome are born Kings, and many have made themſelves Kings over Countries, and Nations of people, which yet could never conquer their own thoughts, but continued ſlaves to their own wills, a man may conquer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by ſtrength of arms, and policy, but a man can never conquer his own thoughts truly; untill nature be helped by ſanctifying graces: in as much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as grace ſuperadded to nature, makes it in every thing more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95743:70"/> by ſo much is the Chriſtian rightly ruling his own thoughts, more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then other men.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding what can be ſaid for the praiſe of them that govern their thoughts aright: yet there are many in the world, and they men of no mean parts, who admire, and by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, advance the government of Houſes, Churches, and Kingdomes, who yet decry the ordering of the heart, the government of the thoughts as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, or impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>But needleſſe it is not, as ye may perceive by our prefixed diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the needfulneſſe of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoughts, and this that followes.</p>
                     <p>The inward government of the ſoul, is the preſident for all external governments among men, and the Heathen knew this who called man a little world: if <hi>Moſes</hi> had not ſeen the form of the Tabernacle in the mount, he could never have made it, to Gods mind, &amp; if men do not frame a form of government in their own minds, they will hardly be able to form a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment acceptable to men, as he that will govern the Church, muſt firſt learn
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95743:71"/> to govern his own houſe: ſo muſt he begin to rule well in that private little place of his own heart, that minds to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern others: the beſt men are the beſt Kings, and the moſt conquering their own hearts, are the greateſt Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies.</p>
                     <p>Again, he that governs his thoughts well, God will ſubdue all his enemies under him, all the rebellions of his own fleſh, ſhall yield to him, all the ſtrivings of the world againſt him, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; he rides on conquering all things, and not to be conquered: but he that is of a looſe and diſordered carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own ſoul, ſhall find his thoughts and actions as looſe to him, as his care is over them.</p>
                     <p>Impoſſible it is not, for a Righteous man to govern his thoughts aright: though I muſt confeſſe that to nature unreformed, it is impoſſible; as alſo that where nature is renewed, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection of this gift is not attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, before the enjoyment of glory.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding the meaner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees may and ought to be expected from God, and are attained unto by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95743:71"/> good Chriſtian in this life: for God hath promiſed to give unto his ſervants a new heart, and that his grace ſhall be ſufficient for them.<bibl>Jer. 31.</bibl> Wherefore ſeeing nothing is impoſſible, to whom God hath promiſed poſſibility; let not us be diſcouraged from preſcribing, let not others be diſcouraged from receiving rules for government of our thoughts, being a work both poſſible and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Rule 1. It will be the wiſdom of every Righteous man to lift up the head of ſome juſt thought into place of Eminency, and Command in his mind; whereunto all the reſt muſt be ſubject, which muſt have both coercive and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active power, like that Centurion in the Goſpel, and ſay to one thought go, and to another come: parity, if but in thought, is next to mutiny; orderly government amongſt equals, is a ſoloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme in Politicks.</p>
                     <p>But where may we find ſuch a Saint among the people, ſuch a thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the cogitations, as may overtop all the reſt? what if thou ſhalt ſet up the thought of Gods fear upon the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95743:72"/> throne of thy heart, holding up the Scepter of Gods word, and taking up the Regency of thy whole man, as of the multitude of thy thoughts. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the fear of God taking it in the Scripture ſenſe, <hi>pro toto Dei cultu,</hi> for the whole worſhip of God, is moſt meet to be a Maſter, a Prince over all our thoughts; for what but religion ſhould be the main ſcope of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans whole life? and what rather then this ſhould command all the company of our thoughts into order amongſt themſelves, and into the obedience of Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>What is it which the Pſalmiſt chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſeth to teach his children, but the fear of the Lord? <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Come ye children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord:</hi>

                        <bibl>pſal. 34. 11</bibl> many would be accounted wiſe and prudent, but none are truly wiſe, but they that ſet up the fear of God in their hearts. <q rend="inline">

                        <bibl>Prov. 14. 6.</bibl> alas, wiſdom lyes not in the ſcorners way, nor amongſt their great men, and wiſe men of the world, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>whoſe wiſdom is but fooliſhneſſe with God.</hi>

                        <bibl>1 Cor. 3. 19.</bibl>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:95743:72"/> Where lyes it then, but amongſt them that are religious? <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdome.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Prov. 9. 10.</bibl> Doubtleſſe they have a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that do thereafter; <hi>the praiſe of it endureth for ever.</hi> And ſet this further upon your hearts; conſider that they which deſpiſe that wiſdome, which the fear of the Lord teacheth, are but fools for their labour; <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom, but fools deſpiſe wiſdom and inſtruction:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Prov. 1. 7.</bibl> my advice is therefore, that ye ſet this fear of the Lord, as Regent over your thoughts.</p>
                     <p>If ye pleaſe to look amongſt the men of this world, ye ſhall ſee a Maſter thought higher then the reſt, in every unregenerate man, at whoſe beck all the reſt as underlings bow, and give obedience, not unſitly compared to the Maſter Bee in the Hive, whoſe riſing or ſettling carries with it the whole ſwarm. Thus the thought of covetouſneſſe in <hi>Judas,</hi> of fame in <hi>Magus,</hi> of idolatry in <hi>Jezabel,</hi> of adultery in <hi>Herod,</hi> of honour in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> of revenge in <hi>Cain,</hi>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:95743:73"/> of nigardize in <hi>Nabal,</hi> of ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the unjuſt ſteward, were as the Pole-ſtarre, about which, all the reſt of their thoughts moved reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</p>
                     <p>In the thoughts of a wicked man, the thoughts of ſome ſin takes the throne, in whoſe government he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: this thought drives out all good ones that ſtand in his way and oppoſe him, and if any be received in, 'tis but with reſervation of power to remove them again at pleaſure. And even evill thoughts themſelves which are not of the ſame kind with the principal, are ſo farre countenanced as ſerviceable to the Regents purpoſe: ſo the thought of ambition, brings in all other thoughts of revenge; Covetouſneſſe, Pride, Envie, &amp;c. to be her ſervants: ſo that a man may ſay, ſuch Maſter, ſuch Servants; ſuch Miſtreſſe, ſuch Maids: and when they ceaſe to be ſerviceable to their Maſters main deſign, he caſts them off, and takes in others.</p>
                     <p>If wicked men be thus wiſe in their generations, let the children of light
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95743:73"/> learn to be more wiſe then they; and let them alſo enthrone the thought of Gods fear, and delight in her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then evil thoughts will vaniſh as the miſts before the morning Sun: this will take in all thoughts of ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and words, and works, as may be ſerviceable to the worſhip of God, and make even thoſe inferiour thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things indifferent, and the lawful buſineſſes of our calling ſubſervient and profitable to her main deſign of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God: and when they ceaſe to be ſo ſerviceable, the fear of God enthroned among the thoughts, will caſt them off.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond rule, Let all thy thoughts be ordered according to Gods word, for if the fear of God be Regent, the word of God is her known Law, by which ſhe governs; The teſtimonies of the Lord, as they were the delight, ſo they were the Counſellers of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Thy Teſtimonies are my delight, and my Counſellers,</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Pſal. 1 19. 24.</bibl> they muſt be Counſellers to every ſoul that lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fear of God: Religion hath no Law above Scripture, nor equal
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95743:74"/> with it: and that man cannot have ſet up the fear of God in his heart, who underſets the Scripture, or ſpeaks againſt it, or behaves himſelf froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the rule thereof. That man cannot have a good thought in his heart, who hath an evil heart to the Scripture: But as when <hi>Moſes</hi> took the rod into his hand, the waters ſtood on heaps, and divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above and beneath: So when the heart which fears God takes into conſideration the word of God, the thoughts that come from above, and the thoughts which come from below, divide themſelves, and ſtart aſunder: in which ſenſe, the word is called <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Heb. 4. 12.</bibl> Wherefore that evil thoughts may divide from thee, and good thoughts may ſtay with thee; let all thy thoughts come before the word of God: Religion wil allow no thoughts under her government, but ſuch as wil be ruled by her Laws.</p>
                     <p>And this rule I have given the more willingly, leſt any thoughts ariſing out
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95743:74"/> of zeal and affection to Religion, and not according to the word of God, ſhould uſurpe amongſt you the name of Good thoughts. In this kind I obſerve Gods children commit great errours, packing many unwarrantable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable actions upon ſeeming good affections to the fear of God. I love thoſe perſons whoſe good meanings and good affections make them zealous of Religion: but I love and honour that ſoul more, whoſe affections are zealous, yet wil not allow that for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is not according to Gods Word: if any other opinion get the ſtampe of men upon it for religious: its more than I know that it hath Gods Image and Superſcription upon it.</p>
                     <p>3. That thou mayeſt govern thy thoughts aright: Conſider thine own ſtanding, and qualification, in the Church of God; for every ſeveral ſtanding and ſtate, require ſeveral thoughts. The Apoſtle marſhals Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians into three ranks:<bibl>1 John 2. 13.</bibl> Children, young Men, and old Men. Like thoughts
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95743:75"/> become not every age, no more than like apparel doth. <hi>Joſephs</hi> party-coloured Coat, became him, while he was his father <hi>Jacobs</hi> wanton; but when he was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Counſellour, he muſt put on his graver habits. While the Apoſtle was a child, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>he ſpake as a child, he underſtood as a child, he thought as a child; but when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man, be put away childiſh things.</hi>
                        </q> It may beſeem a child to hang upon the mothers breaſts, to ſtand at her knee, to be carried in her armes, to play away time, and truſt all to the care of father and mother, and cry for what he lacks: But young-men who are ſtrong, muſt think of fightings and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>overcoming the wicked one:</hi> and old men <hi>who have known him that is from the beginning,</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>1 Joh. 2. 13.</bibl> muſt be grave, ſober, examples unto others, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others, filled with the fulneſſe of God, beyond the unſtayed thoughts of the child, or diſtempered motions of young-men. What an unnatural thing it is, to ſee children ruling their fathers, old men hanging upon the Paps, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95743:75"/> young men in their full ſtrength lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Crutch? The thoughts of a King, become not the ſtate of a beggar: the poor man muſt think how to ſpeak ſupplications: the rich man how to diſtribute: the miniſter to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Word aright, and to feed the flock of Chriſt: the tradeſman not to defraud or circumvent his brother in any thing. When mens thoughts are ſuitable to their own ſtanding in the Church, and their own Calling in the world, there is a harmony in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and they are mutually helpful. In Martial affairs, if the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier run upon the Captains office: in houſhold-government, if the ſervant will do the Maſters buſineſſe: in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, if the Common man will act as Lord Mayor, their communions are but confuſions: but where every one takes, and keepeth his own place, how pleaſant is the whole action? Let every man conſider his own ſtanding and qualification in the Church of God, and let no man <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>think of himſelf above that which is fitting, but let him think ſoberly.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:95743:76"/>
                     <p> 4. Rule: Take a view of all thy thoughts, as that Maſter did who took an account of his ſervants: ſo do thou call thy thoughts together, and take notice of what kind they are, of what worth they are, of what uſefulneſſe they are, to the ſervice of the fear of God: Its probable thou mayeſt finde ſome evil ſervants among them that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be good; ſome unprofitable ones among them that ſeem to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſome leſſe ſerviceable among them that ſeem to be moſt; and ſome more ſerviceable among them that ſeem to be leſſe: It wil be thy wiſdom to know the ſtate of thy thoughts; and as the mouth taſtes meat, and the eare tryes words, ſo let the heart try her own thoughts; bring them to the trial of Gods Word, as gold to the Touchſtone: and accordingly as they endure this touch, ſo account of them for current or baſe ſilver: For as in a great houſe, there be veſſels of gold, and veſſels of ſilver, and veſſels of wood, and of ſtone: ſo are the thoughts in a mans heart, ſome for honour, and ſome for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95743:76"/> diſhonour, ſome for nobler, and ſome for meaner employments, and ſome not uſeful at all.</p>
                     <p>5. Having thus viewed thy own thoughts, what thoughts are found to be of an evil kind, lay them aſide, how pretious ſo ever they were in thine eyes. Our ſervants though of a good appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet if they want worth and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to us, muſt ſeek them new maſters: ſo ſhould our thoughts do. That thought which is found not to fear God, let it not tarry in thy ſight: if Gold want weight, or be embaſed, it paſſeth not for current: if meat be never ſo wel cooked, yet if it be not ſweet, it wil not down with us. And ſhal we be wiſe for our bodies, for our eſtates, for our houſes? Let us be much more wiſe for our ſouls: and if thou have once caſt out an evil thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and wicked, let it not be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained again, no not though it might do thee ſome appearing ſervice. Every man is not ſerviceable that looks like a man, and can hold a trencher: Its poſſible a wicked thought accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95743:77"/> may ſtand thee inſtead for the world, ſuch thoughts are not ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the fear of God, nor thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>6. Having caſt off thoſe which are evil: keep ſuch thoughts as are ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and make much of them. I have ſpoken of this already as a rule for getting good thoughts, I need ſpeak the leſſe of it here: onely this: goods are kept as they are gotten: he that makes not much of little which he hath, will hardly get any more: and he that makes not much of that which he hath, looſeth it by careleſneſſe. There's much good husbandry within doors in ſaving that which we have, as without doors, till we have got it in: a good huſwife at home, is as needful, as a good huſband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
                     <p>7. Thoſe thoughts which are retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let them have their due place: ſome thoughts are about things purely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, other are about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and ſome about buſineſſes of our lawful Callings: all may have their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95743:77"/> place, and their ſeaſons; but much wiſdom is required in giving theſe thoughts what belongs to them: they are all uſeful, and none of them to be contemned if they keep their places. <hi>Martha</hi> is needful in the houſe, as well as <hi>Mary:</hi> But <hi>Mary</hi> muſt have the firſt place, becauſe her part choſen is the better: the younger children in the family muſt have portions provided; but firſt-borns muſt have a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: our Divine thoughts muſt have the preeminence; for the excellency of dignity belongs unto them: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſſe thereof:</hi>
                        </q> yet worldly thoughts are needful in their places. I like not that Monkiſh pretenſe to thruſt all worldly and recreatory thoughts out of the mind, as too baſe to come into their Cloiſters: for thus they make themſelves unprofitable to the ſocieties of men, and diſſenters from the rule of Chriſt, who would not that ſuch as are devoted to his worſhip, ſhould go out of the world,<bibl>John 17.</bibl> but be kept from the evil of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95743:78"/> world. And I account it an errour on the formal Proteſtants part alſo, to thruſt out better thoughts, for the entertainment of worſe: whereas it ſhould be a Chriſtians care rightly to ſubordinate the lower thoughts to the higher, the baſer, to the better: I can think that worldly thoughts are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants, though they be bad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. <hi>Zibah</hi> did his Maſter <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth</hi> good ſervice, till he got above him: but then a ſervants allowance will not content him; he will be pleaſed with no leſſe then the whole inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Even ſo our inferiour thoughts may do religion good ſervice, while they keep their ſubordination, but if they juſtle out religious thoughts themſelves; it's time for a righteous man to put them again into their own place.</p>
                     <p>The eigth Rule is: Let the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſely mixe his ſpiritual and other lawful thoughts together; it's a part of the cogitative faculty to intermixe the ſpecies of things received, and 'tis the office of a wiſe Chriſtian to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95743:78"/> his thoughts together, ſo as they may be helpful one to another, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the worſhip of God: a mans thoughts ſhould be agreeable to his preſent ſtate, and condition, which being the ſtate of a travailer betwixt earth and heaven, he ſhould be like the Pilot in his ſhip, <hi>oculus ad coelum, manus ad clavem,</hi> lifting up his eyes to heaven, and laying his hand upon the Card: when the husband-man can at the ſame time lay his hand on the Plough; <hi>&amp; ad ſtivam aliquid Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum,</hi> ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> heart, there is a ſweet mixture of thoughts in him: God indeed hath allowed unto man one kinde of thoughts for his work, another for his devotion; yet when we are at our labour, we may eaſily perceive our minds are more nimble to think, then our hands to work; ſo that in all the buſineſſe of our calling, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpaces for holy thoughts: ſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant was ſent out to take a wife for his young Maſter, and ſtood watering the Camels at the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95743:79"/> Well, he found a ſpace for that prayer: <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>Oh Lord God of my Maſter</hi> Abraham, <hi>I pray thee ſend me good ſpeed this day, and ſhew kindneſſe unto my Maſter</hi> Abraham.</q>
                        <bibl>Gen. 24. 12.</bibl>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Rule; Let the Righteous mans thoughts have their ſeaſons and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: there is a time for mixtures, and yet the ſeaſon of every thing muſt be regarded, all thoughts of mirth make us ſecure, all muſing upon judgement is the high way to deſperation. All our thoughts upon priviledges and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, may poſſibly lift us up, and all thoughts of ſin and judgement may make us unprofitable to men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable to our ſelves: here mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is convenient, yet ſeaſons muſt be obſerved, and ſucceſſions. There is a time for all things, and he that is able to diſcern the time and ſeaſon of his thoughts, is a wiſe man: the mind is an active Agent, and hath almoſt infinite things to think of; yet being it ſelf of a finite and limited poſſibility, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity take ſeaſonable opportunities, as the means to produce actions in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95743:79"/> ſucceſſion, where thoughts have not their allotmenss of ſuitable time, they will be diſorderly, confuſed, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and impertinent.</p>
                     <p>Where this is not obſerved; two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences do uſually trouble the righteous man.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, when he ſhould mind the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of holineſſe, the thoughts of his calling break in upon him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when he ſhould tend the buſineſſe of his calling his religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are to do; which ſhould have been done before, both theſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are avoyded; by ſetting our thoughts to their time, and keeping them to their orderly ſucceſſions. But here I muſt commit the Reader to his own ſpiritual wiſdom, which may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect for the time and ſeaſon of his own thoughts, and which ſhould be firſt, and which ſhould be laſt, better then any other can do.</p>
                     <p>Yet herein I will give my advice; let him imitate wiſe States-men, who hear and diſpatch buſineſſes of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt concernment firſt, and then thoſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95743:80"/> that are of leſſer concernment; uſually ſpiritual thoughts are meet to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched firſt, for they are of the higheſt concernment, next the thoughts of our calling; and laſtly, thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation: yet I confeſſe this advice is not generall for all purpoſes, and for all perſons: general Rules have their exceptions, and ſo hath this: heavenly thoughts are without controverſie our beſt thoughts, yet worldly thoughts and recreatory thoughts, have their uſe; and in caſe of extreme neceſſity of the body, muſt have the firſt place, and be done firſt: if my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Oxe or his Aſſe be fallen into a pit, I muſt lift him out, though it be on the Sabbath day. If my houſe be on fire, I muſt think to quench it, rather then to go into my Cloſet to prayer, or into the Pulpit to preach, or into the Church to hear. If my brother be ready to ſtarve for want of cloathing, to famiſh for want of food, my almes is more ſeaſonable then my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; my cloth then my good word:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95743:80"/> goe and learn what that meanes. <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. Rule: In the government of all thy thoughts, be careful thou have no violent paſſion, of what kind ſoever, upon thy ſpirit: a paſſionate man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a juſt governour of his own thoughts: paſſion of what kind ſoever, if violent, is the great enemy to a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled order of good thoughts. Who, that ſaw <hi>David</hi> in his unlawful love to <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> in his grief for <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and in his rage againſt <hi>Nabal,</hi> would have called him a man after Gods own heart, or a man of compoſed thoughts? Paſſions diſorder the whole man, as the ſudden incurſion of a wing of Horſe, diſ-ranks a Company of Foot-men, and puts them into ſuch confuſion, that every one is ready to fall foul upon his fellow. Do paſſions break in upon thy thoughts? what an altered man thou art? thy mind like an <hi>Eden</hi> before them, repleniſhed with variety of good thoughts, but behind them, a barren Wilderneſſe, uneaven, and rough, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95743:81"/> over-grown with unpleaſant and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable intentions, and reſolutions, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to evil. Oh the miſerable eſtate of our ſouls when they are hurried along upon the wheels of paſſion, and how unperceived are a mans deſcents to wickedneſſe in thoſe his fits? and after the ſtorm of them is a little over; what a trouble it is to look back upon his miſcarriages? what a labour to gather up his ſcattered good thoughts again? Wherefore if thou deſire to ſettle the government of thy thoughts in peace and ſafety, look well to thy paſſions, that they be not too ſtrong for thee.</p>
                     <p>I may not ſay all paſſions are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawful in a Chriſtian, we are all men of paſſions: and even <hi>Elijah</hi> that great Prophet, <q rend="inline">
                           <hi>was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are,</hi>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>Jam. 5. 17.</bibl> ſaid a great Apoſtle. Prophets and Apoſtles had their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Holy and Juſt men, have them ſtill; and I could tell you, that they are ſometimes of great uſe, to carry on Religious deſires; as zeal in Chriſt himſelf, moved him to whip buyers and ſellers out of the Temple:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95743:81"/> But I muſt not follow this Precept to the full, leſt I ſhould inſert ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe. I will therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this rule, and all elſe that hath been writen in this matter, to your Chriſtian care; in the uſe of them, and your ſouls to the direction, and protection of God, who lives for ever.</p>

                  <p>Before we proceed let us view a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</note> the context, or coherence, wherein take notice of theſe two particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, how carefull God is even where he denounceth the extream judgements againſt ſinners, yet even there to add the ſweeteſt promiſes to the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95743:86"/> of his people: for verſe 21. he tells the wicked he will reprove them, and ſet their ſins before them in order (as it were in battail array) and verſe 22. ſpeaks of tearing of them in pieces, ſo that there be none to deliver them: yet here verſe 23. annexeth the promiſe of ſalvation to his people, leſt they ſhould be diſcouraged; and declareth, that his ſeverity to the one, ſhould not hinder his bounty and mercy to the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, obſerve here verſe 23. the ſweet harmony betwixt praiſing of God, and ordering our converſation aright, betwixt a thankfull heart, and a well guided life, they are both couched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one verſe: as two loving companions unſeparably knit together with a conjunction copulative: and the one gloriſieth God, and by conſequence ſhall be glorified of God, and the other ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God, and by conſequence did firſt honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God: the ſum of the whole is, That vocal praiſe is never right, unleſs vital thankfulneſs follows, and ſo to him that ordereth his converſation
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95743:87"/> aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God.</p>
                  <p>Which words are an entire, full and ſubſtantial doctrine in themſelves, take them aſunder, and theſe particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or doctrinal truths, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. That it is our duty, to order our coverſation aright.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The conſideration of the infallible truth of Gods ſhewing us his ſalvation, ought to be an encouragement to us, to make us careful in the ordering our converſation aright.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe particulars will fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the handling of the full textual doctrine, which is this.</p>

                     <hi>To every one that orders his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright, God will ſhew his ſalvation;</hi> If we be agents in the former, God will ſurely make us patients in the latter. For the opening of which doctrine, I will ſtand a little upon the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95743:87"/> of the words in the Text. <note place="margin">What is meant by converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, what we are to underſtand by converſation, that is the way or courſe of his life, both in his thoughts, words, and actions, wherein he converſeth with God, man, or his own ſelf. It is a word of a large extent, it reacheth to mans whole life, and all the ſeveral paſſages and buſineſſes thereof, ſome men can demean themſelves pretty well in ſome buſineſſe, and in ſome company, and on ſome occaſions; but if you look to the general frame and courſe of their lives, it is naught: but the promiſe in my text, is made to a man whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is right. That is the whole and all the parcels thereof, the tenour of his life is right, (for the main) both in his general and particular calling in his works of mercy to the needy. Secondly, of juſtice towards all. Thirdly of piety towards God. Fourthly of ſobriety towards himſelf. Again, it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly compoſing of our ſelves in all eſtates of adverſity or proſperity, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>we be abaſed or abound, Phil.</hi> 4. 12. and in all his relations or references that carries himſelf well; whether he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95743:88"/> be a Magiſtrate or Miniſter, Maſter or Servant, Child or Parents.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly in all occurrences of divine providence, here lieth the buſineſſe of the converſation in all theſe by which you may perceive, that it is no eaſie matter to compaſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly what is to order the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Firſt to order is a word of <note place="margin">What it is to order.</note> wiſdom. It is a point of wiſdom, and requireth a great deal of ſkil and art, methodically to diſpoſe of our waies. God ſaid before verſe 27. <hi>That he would ſet the ſins of the wicked before them,</hi> as it were marching in array; and he requireth of good men to order their converſation aright.</p>
                  <p>It is a word of diligence as well as wiſdom, and ſpeaks a great deal of pains and diligence in the diſpoſing of the variety of our buſineſſe, yea and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe too, in bringing out every thing beautiful in its ſeaſon: to order a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to order a ſtate, to rule a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is a mighty matter: even ſo it is for a man to rule his own mind; which who ſo doth, is better and ſtronger then he that overcometh a City,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95743:88"/> Prov. 16. 32. art may do the one, but <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 32.</note> onely grace can effect the latter, he that overcometh a City, vanquiſheth but men, but he that ruleth his own mind, his paſſions, &amp;c. the little Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of himſelf, overcometh devils principalities, and powers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ordering is a word of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, and implieth bringing about of things to an iſſue, and a continuation unto the end; for what is order, but a <note place="margin">Ordo eſt diſpoſitio à primo ad ultimum per media.</note> diſpoſition of things from the firſt to the laſt by means conducing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the next place we are to conſider what it is to order aright or ſtraightly: now a thing may be ſaid to be right.</p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Whats meant by aright.</note>
                  <p>Firſt, that hath rectitude from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is the cauſe of rightneſſe in all other things, and ſo God is onely right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly that may be ſaid to be right that hath its rectitude from another, yet there is in it an infallible rule to ſquare other things by it, and in this ſenſe the Law of God is ſaid to be right, Pſal. 19.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:95743:89"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, things or perſons may be ſaid to be right, which are neither the cauſe of rectitude in others, nor yet properly a rule to ſquare other things by, yet are they rightly fitted to the true rule, and of this are three kinds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt ſuch a rightneſſe as anſwereth exactly to the rule, both for kinds and degrees. And, ſo onely Chriſts conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was ordered aright, he onely fully accompliſhing perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a thing may be ſaid to be right, which though it be not wholly directed for matter, manner, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet is it ſquared thereunto in ſome ſutableneſſe and propertion evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical: and though there be ſome aberrations and ſwervings in it, yet in compariſon of the way of the wicked, and in reſpect of the purpoſe of the heart, the bent of the will, the ſincerity of the ſoul, and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the life: And withal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods gracious acceptance it may be called an ordering of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation aright. Which I ſpeak to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95743:89"/> prevent diſcouragement in weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſo that we may well expound the meaning of my text, by that 119. <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 133.</note> Pſal. 133. <hi>order my ſteps in thy word.</hi> And to order in thy word, is as much as rightly to diſpoſe it, the word of God being the rule of right, it muſt have warrant from the word; and be conformed to it from the word; and to conclude, thus then is a matter orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aright, when it holdeth propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the rule, and is carried ſutably.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Secondly, when it proceedeth from a right principle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. even a pure heart, a good cauſe, and faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faigned.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when it is carried on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a right ground and motive: as, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the love of God, conſcience of duty, &amp;c. and diſcharged in a right manner, in ſincerity, in humility, in the preſence of God, to be approved of him. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, when it is directed to a good end, which is the glory of God. Oppoſite hereunto are the indirect crooked turnings and windings of all graceleſſe perſons, who pervert their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95743:90"/> waies. See Proverbs 10. 9.</p>
                  <p>Now for the promiſe annexed on Gods <note place="margin">Whats meant by ſalvation.</note> part, it is as full and large, all bleſſings are couched under ſalvation: Salvation is as much as protection, ſafety, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in this life, and that which is to come: the ſalvation of God is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſalvation: for the addition of (God) in my Text, notes the excellency of it, as the mountains of God are excellent mountains: and the ſalvation ſpoken of, is either ordinary or extraordinary; and both, that which is begun in this world, as alſo that final receiving the end of our faith, even the ſalvation of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that he will give us a glimpſe and ſight of it in this world, by manifeſting of it to our ſouls, and aſſuring us of it, ſay unto my ſoul, <hi>I am thy ſalvation;</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Pſal. 35. 3. <hi>he ſhall ſee himſelf ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the injoying and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, Pſal. 85. 7. Having thus taken the words aſunder, and explained them, I will now joyn them together, and prove the truth of the entire propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:95743:90"/>
                  <p> Nothing is more clear in Scripture <note place="margin">Proof of the point.</note> then this, that God hath linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſanctification and ſalvation in an unſeparable and Adamantine chain, never to be broken: all the Bible throughout witneſſeth that holineſſe ever ends in happineſſe: What is it to order our converſation aright, but to lead a godly life? And hath not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come, 1 Tim. 4. 8. yes, and the performances too: the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid promiſes, <hi>thoſe that have their fruit in holineſſe, ſhall have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22</note> 
                     <hi>their end everlaſting life,</hi> and they that go to heaven, are ſaid to receive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among thoſe that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: many and precious promiſes are ſcattered throughout the world, ſome to perſons that fear God, ſome to thoſe that love God, &amp;c. but all belong to thoſe that order their converſation aright, ſee Pſal. 91. 10. 11. This alſo may be proved negatively on the other ſide, that none ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God, but they that order their converſation aright; <hi>without holineſſe,</hi> ſaith the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95743:91"/> Apoſtle, <hi>no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. And doth not our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſt in the viſion of God: mark well theſe three particulars. Firſt for holineſſe. Secondly, <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Thirdly, with holineſſe, none but he ſhall ſee the God of his ſalvation: this is alſo proved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally on both ſides, both affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and negatively, Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die, but if ye through the ſpirit mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next for the ſhewing us his ſalvation, <note place="margin">Whats meant to ſhew us his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> or making us know our intereſt in it, that is alſo true ſooner or later, more or leſſe, he that orders his converſation aright ſhall ſee it. Yea it holds propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, the more exactly the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſquared, the more clear aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is given to ſuch a perſon. See for this how confidently <hi>David</hi> affirms of himſelf, Pſal. 27. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth is laid up for me a Crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi> It is the promiſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95743:91"/> Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them,</hi> (there is the right ordering of the converſation) <hi>I will love, and manifeſt my ſelf unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <note place="margin">The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Point.</note>
                  <p>The grounds of this truth: the firſt lieth in Gods free-grace, and dependeth on the faithfulneſſe of his promiſe; for there is no proportion betwixt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation for a ſhort time, and Gods ſalvation for ever, to be joyned: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our imperfect ſanctification, and Gods perfect ſalvation: but God hath engaged himſelf by promiſe to us. It is a Reward of favour, not of debt, as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. It is not from the merit of our workes, but from the meer mercy of God:</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Laſtly, becauſe God hath ordered matters ſo: that grace ſhould be the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95743:92"/> ſeed of glory, as they are of the ſame kind, and near of kin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>He that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall reape of the ſpirit life everlaſting:</hi> and all this is, that ſo God might Crown his own gifts in us: not our merits: and that he might honour himſelf, as wel as pleaſure us.</p>
                  <p>To improve this Point to our beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: firſt we may uſe it by way <note place="margin">1 Uſe of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of encouragement, to excite and ſtir up all ſorts of perſons to be willing to ſet upon this Duty, and to make conſcience of the ordering of their converſations aright.

                  <p>The preſſing Conſiderations to ſet home the Exhortation on our ſouls, may be theſe that follow.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond encouragement I wil uſe, <note place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ſecunda</note> ſhal be this; becauſe this wil denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate us bleſſed perſons, even while we live; and who is there that would not be bleſſed? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 1. <hi>Bleſſed are they that are undefiled in the way, and walk in the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, all our profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wil prove but vanity: our faith wil be but a meer phanſie; and all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, but as ſo many glorious ſuns, onely in the way of holineſſe lyeth the beauty and comelineſſe of all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95743:93"/> This is the Diamond in the Ring, that graceth all our other parts &amp; accompliſhments: no true peace, ſafety, comfort, or ſecurity, is elſewhere to be found, either in our life or death: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>All the wayes of wiſdom, are wayes of pleaſure, and all her paths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,</hi> Prov. 3. 17. and the fear of the Lord, is the onely wiſdom: experiment it who pleaſeth. In other wayes he ſhal find a great deal of craggineſſe, and bitterneſſe in the end of all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly conſider Gods wayes to us: <note place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio tertia.</note> 
                     <hi>all his wayes are mercy and truth, to thoſe that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 25. 10. It is not ſaid, ſome of his wayes are mercy; and ſome of his wayes are truth: but <hi>all his wayes are both mercy and truth:</hi> mercy in promiſing, and truth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming. And why then ſhould you think it much that all our wayes and dealings ſhould reliſh of holineſſe and obedience towards God? all his wayes are to pleaſure us: and in equity, all our wayes ſhould be to pleaſe him. Or conſider Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8. he came down from heaven to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the work of our Redemption:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95743:93"/> and ſhal not we come out of the world for his ſake, and have our converſations in heaven? Chriſt emptied himſelf for us, <hi>and took upon him the forme of a ſervant, and humbled himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe;</hi> and all for our ſakes. It is written of him, <hi>that he pleaſed not himſelf,</hi> Rom. 15. 3. And ſhal we ſo ill requite our Lord and Saviour, as to order our courſes to pleaſe others, or humour our ſelves, to follow the guiſe of the times, and ſo content our own luſts? and not rather to pleaſe him in every thing we doe? I pray you lay this meditation cloſe to your hearts.</p>
                  <p>This in the fourth place, is the one <note place="margin">Fourth Motive.</note> thing neceſſary in all our life: <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. <hi>this is that good part, which whoſoever chooſeth, it ſhall never be taken from him:</hi> All other things are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, in compariſon of this: <hi>He that keepeth his way, keepeth his ſoul,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prov. 16. 7. The very life and ſoul lieth at ſtake in this buſineſſe. Suppoſe thou canſt rightly weild an
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95743:94"/> eſtate, or drive thy trade wel, ſo as to be maſter of it: Suppoſe thou canſt mannage thy actions fairly before men: Suppoſe thou wert able to marſhal an Army, or to rule a City, a Nation, or Kingdom: Suppoſe thou canſt govern a family, and order thy ſervants under thee; Heathens have done all theſe, and a man may go to hell that doth them: But to manage thine own heart and life aright, is a far more excellent thing, and it wil certainly bring thee to Heaven; it being ſuch a thing as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth ſalvation. This is to live the very life of God himſelf; to walke in the way that is called holy: hereby the life of Chriſt appeareth unto us. I conclude this, with that of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Who is a wiſe man, and endued with knowledge amongſt you? let him ſhew out of a good converſation his workes with meekeneſſe of wiſdom.</hi> Mark; firſt the frame of his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be good: ſecondly his works muſt flow out of the ſame, and be made apparent: thirdly the manner of the carriage of his works: It muſt be in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95743:94"/> meekeneſſe of wiſdom. What ſhould I need to preſſe you any further, either that ſo doing you ſhall beautifie your Profeſſion, and adorn Religion? or that hereby you ſhal ſtop the mouths of enemies, and put them to a ſtand, that they ſhal not be able with any face, to ſpeak evil of you, or of godlineſſe; but all their pretenſes ſhal be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: or that hereby you ſhal much honour the work of God in your own hearts; that that grace we ſpeak ſo much of, is not an empty ſound, or meer notion, but there is a reality in it, a life and power which wil make us do ſomething more than the common ſpheare of mankind is able to effect. You are in Covenant with God, and being ſo, are a Law to your ſelves: Oh I beſeech you, let your actions be ſuitable to your principles: you ſee the beauty of holineſſe: <hi>You are a holy nation, a royal prieſthood, a precious people,</hi> therefore ſhew forth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of him, <hi>that hath called you out of darkneſſe, into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>Let your converſation be</hi>

This is the order of the Scripture; firſt

We muſt not only leave ſinne in outward action, but abhorre it in the inward affection; not onely do that which is good, but cleave to it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it: otherwiſe we ſhall never be conſtant and cheerful in the doing of good: and alſo we ſhall quickly return with the <hi>dogge to his vomit,</hi> in the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon that which is evill: thus a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95743:99"/> man walking in his calling, muſt firſt loath the ſins incident to his calling, and then love to put in exerciſe the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical duties of the ſame, otherwiſe his faults will marre his duties, but his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will not mend his faults; when men make conſcience to avoyd ſin, that will facilitate, and more eaſily introduce the ſervice of God: and here alſo it muſt be your wiſdom to pitch your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not to give way to harbour any ſin, be it never ſo ſmall; for whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver breaketh one, keepeth none of the commandements. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. ſome think, that though they allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in one thing that is evill, yet they may order their converſation aright in other matters; but what ſaith <hi>Salomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 1. dead flyes cauſe the oyntment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour; ſo doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and honour: ſo then as we muſt make conſcience to refrain our feet with <hi>David, from every evill way:</hi> Pſal. 119. 101. that ſo we may keep Gods word; ſo eſpecially from our darling, boſome, and predominant corruptions,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95743:100"/> ſuch as our natural inclination or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, our profit or pleaſure, have made as dear to us as our right eye, or right hand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly from ſecret ſins, the very ſhame of men may keep us from open ſins: but it muſt be the fear of God that keeps and preſerves from ſecret ones, to which none are privie, but our own ſoules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we muſt ſhun not only foul and ſcandalous ſins, but even leſſer ones: as petty oaths, fooliſh jeſting, merry talking, as the world ſtiles it, wherein ſometimes there is a great deal of evil, miſpence of precious time, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we muſt by all means, take heed of the ſins of the times wherein we live, and the ſins of our particular callings, or elſe we ſhall be enſnared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be aware. And as without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, we muſt leave all ſin, ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, we muſt make conſcience of every duty; wittingly, and willingly, not living in the neglect of any one of them; then ſhall we not be confounded, when we have reſpect unto all Gods commandements. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. ſome
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95743:100"/> men make conſcience to be juſt in their words and deeds, but little care of the duties of piety to God, or mercy to wards the poor, but the fruit of the ſpirit is, in all goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe; ſo ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. ch. 5, 6. &amp; 9. Yea further, we muſt make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the moſt uncouth and harſheſt duties, ſuch as by nature we are moſt averſe from, as <hi>loving our enemies, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of thoſe that curſe us, praying for thoſe perſecute us.</hi> Matth. 5. 44. ſo likewiſe of ſecret duties. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. as of private prayer, liberality to the poor, which give the ſoundeſt teſtimonies to our own ſoules, of our ſincerity towards God, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 13. now that we may do all this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, a great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and skill, is required in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we may be able to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt good and evil; we muſt therefore prove, <hi>what that perfect good, and acceptable will of God is,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. and be much verſt in Scripture, where the rules and directions for ordering our converſations aright, are delivered; we muſt have a care that the word of God
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95743:101"/> 
                     <hi>dwell plenteouſly and richly in us.</hi> Col. 3. 16. elſe we ſhall never be able to order our ſteps in the word, which is only the directing of them aright. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſimilitude of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> in a Sermon of his, which was the means of the converſion of that noble <hi>Italian Galeacius, Caracciolus,</hi> Suppoſe ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> a man were upon the top of an hill, and caſting his eyes down to the valley, ſhould there behold a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of perſons, frisking, and skipping, would he not think they were mad, and out of their wits; but afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, and coming nearer and nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto them, and hearing the muſick, and marking how they danced accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, and kept their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and proportions, he is much taken therewith; and eſteemeth that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which before he counted folly: even ſo doth the converſation of Gods people, looked upon at a diſtance, and and by it ſelf conſidered, ſeem to many madneſs and folly; and they think it ſtrange, that you run not with them into the ſame exceſſe of riot: and therefore, <hi>they ſpeak evill of you.</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:95743:101"/> 1 Pet. 4. 4. but viewing their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations more cloſely and exactly, and comparing the ſeveral ſteps thereof, how ſutably it is carried to the word of God, and how men dance according to the harmony of that muſick; then they begin to be much taken with that which before they diſliked, and do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think that this is the moſt glorious life and converſation in the world. It pleaſed God ſo to affect the heart of that Noble Marqueſſe, forementioned, herewith, that he reſolved to ſtudy the Scriptures, and to order his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, and ſo was converted from Popery, to the true Religion, and left his own Countrey, and came to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> (in <hi>Calvins</hi> daies) where he lived holily, and ended his daies happily. So much for the general directions, I come now to the ſpicial ones, and will give you ſome of the principal of them, as they are to be found in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>As firſt the rules for our carriage in <note place="margin">Directions in relation to men.</note> relation to men. Firſt that golden one delivered by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Whatſoever ye would that other</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:95743:102"/> 
                     <hi>men do to you, the ſame do ye to them.</hi> Mark, it is not ſaid, What others do to you, the ſame do ye to them, for that is not always right, but ſome times crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but it is ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that others ſhould do to you,</hi> ſet your ſelves as it were in their rooms, <hi>and do ye the ſame to them;</hi> that is not what you would, or are content in your paſſions that others ſhould do to you; but whatever in right reaſon upon due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and ſound judgement, when you are moſt your ſelves, you would that others ſhould do to you, do ye the ſame to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, remember the Apoſtolical rule, <hi>ſerve one another in love, for it is written, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, Gal.</hi> 5. 13, 14. <hi>We muſt ſeek not every one his own, but one anothers wellfare.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 24. A golden rule to be obſerved in contracts and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations to keep us from over reaching any man, 1 Theſ. 4. 6. and not meerly to do things out of reſpects to our ſelves, but to joyn the wellfare of our neighbour to our own benefit, and what we do to them, to do it out of love.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:95743:102"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, <hi>let nothing be done out of contention, or vain glory, but in lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind, let each eſteem others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then themſelves,</hi> Phil. 2. 3. <hi>and let the ſame mind be in you, that was in Christ Jeſus,</hi> verſe 9. he never did any thing in all his life out of contention or vain glory; and indeed, be the matter of our actions never ſo fair or good, yet either of theſe two, contention or vain glory will fly-blow them, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the action.</p>
                  <p>Again, in all our buſineſſes in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Speciall rules for our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God.</note> unto God, we have theſe rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for the end, that the glory of God be made the white at which we aim in all our natural, civil, or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions; according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 10. 31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God;</hi> this muſt be the Butt that we all muſt ſhoot at.</p>
                  <p>Secondly for Chriſt, <hi>Whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of Chriſt Jeſus, giving thanks to the father by him, Col.</hi> 3. 17. that is, what others do as men, do ye as Chriſtians, you muſt do all in Chriſt his name; that is, upon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95743:103"/> his authority and his warranty, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, in confidence upon him, for acceptation of the ſervice, and praying, and invocating the father in his name, and giving thanks to God by him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whatſoever we do to men, or towards our ſelves, to do it to the Lord; and for the Lords ſake, looking beyond men, and further then our ſelves: ſo in our almes-deeds, to give to Chriſt, in giving to ſuch a man, or woman; <hi>Verily, in as much as ye did it to the leaſt of theſe, ye did it to me, Mat.</hi> 25. 40. So likewiſe the Apoſtle preſcribes to ſervants this duty, Col. 3. 23. <hi>Servants be obedient to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and whatſoever ye do, do it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to the Lord, and not to men, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the reward of inheritance:</hi> and this rule is not to be appropriated unto ſervants, but it reacheth to all maſters alſo, yea to all ranks of perſons, for all the duties of the ſecond table are to be performed to others, muſt flow from our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto God, commanded in the firſt Table, ſo Chriſt told <hi>Peter</hi> that his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95743:103"/> diſcharge in feeding of his ſheep, John 21. 15, 16, 17. ought to ſpring from the love he bare to Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Next for our ſelves take theſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <note place="margin">Rules in relation to our ſelves.</note> out of Scripture; do nothing with a regreet of heart, or reluctancy of conſcience, but labour firſt to have a warranty out of the word for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to reſt upon, a warranty, I ſay, at the leaſt of God his allowance of it, if not of his command; <hi>For what ever is not of faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14. 23. that is, if it be done out of perſwaſion of heart, that it is lawful for the warrant of the action; we muſt do nothing with the check or renitency of our conſciences, againſt the dictates of the ſame: bleſſed is he that condemneth not himſelf (in his conſcience) in that which he performeth, to wit in his actions, verſe 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the end of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is love, out of a pure heart, a good conſcience and faith unfained. 1 Tim. 1. 5. where we are to obſerve, that for the matter of our obedience, it muſt be love, love to God; and love to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95743:104"/> our neighbour; and for the fountain and ſpring of love in our actions, it muſt iſſue from a pure heart, a good conſcience and faith unfaigned, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the ſtreams will never be clear.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the preſcript of the word is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do that which ſeemeth good in thine own eies, but what the Lord thy God commandeth thee, Deut.</hi> 12. 8. 32. If any thing at the firſt bluſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth it ſelf unto thee with a ſhew of good, preſently begin to ſuſpect it, as fearing there is ſome evil couched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and ſee what God ſaith of it in his holy word, <hi>from which thou maiſt not turn, to the right hand or to the left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for the manner of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the word (aright) in my text, all muſt be done in humility, and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and carried on ſutably to the duty which we have in hand: it muſt be done underſtandingly, feelingly, fervently, if we pray, <hi>if any man preach, he muſt ſpeak as the Oracles of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11, approving themſelves to God and the conſciences of the hearers, ſo you
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95743:104"/> ſhall find ſeveral directions for ſeveral diſcharges, Rom. 12. 8. <hi>He that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity, he that ruleth with diligence, he that ſheweth mercy with chearfulneſs,</hi> &amp;c. ſo every one in their relations muſt mainly look to the Cardinal vertue which turneth about all the reſt: as, <hi>let the wife ſee to it, that ſhe reverenceth her husband, Epheſ.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> according as ſhe looketh to that, all her other duties do either ebb or flow, in her, <hi>ſo the husband muſt be careful of the main of all, that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his wife, as Chriſt loved his Church. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25. In one word, order your ſteps ſo, as where God hath laid the fulleſt and the ſtrickteſt charge, there be ſure to ſhew your greateſt care: as in the ſubſtantials of religion, before the circumſtantials or ceremonies, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy before ſacrifice, and the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of loving the Lord with all our hearts before the reſt, Matth. 22. 35, 37, 38. To end this, let all our outward diſcharges ſpring from an heart rightly diſpoſed, elſe it will prove formality or diſſimulation; nothing is any further accepted, then as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95743:105"/> from the heart; whatſoever we do in our particular calling, let it ſpring from our general calling of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and let us exerciſe our general calling in our particular, <hi>Let worldly things be uſed by us with heavenly minds, and as ſtars to mount up towards heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 31. not as the main, but as things upon the By, ſtill uſe them with ſpiritual references to better matters, and then you ſhall have your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in heaven, Phil. 3. 21. Take one rule for the regiment of your thoughts, and keeping of them within their bounds. Phil. 4. 8. <hi>Whatſoever things are truth, whatſoever things are honeſt;</hi> that is, fair, grave, and venerable: <hi>whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever are of good report; if there be any vertue, or if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things;</hi> where you have eight boundaries to confine the ſubject matter of your thoughts unto you: take another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for your words and actions out of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 2. 12. <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do ye, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</hi> The cloſing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95743:105"/> direction, the laſt direction which ſhall cloſe all, is this, That we are to call our ſelves to an ordinary account of our ways, and the leading of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, a duty preſſed upon us in the Word of God, Lament. 3. 40. <hi>Let us ſearch our waies, and turn again unto the Lord our God, Pſal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Examine your ſelves upon your beds, and be ſtill.</hi> The Prophet commands it, <hi>Haggai</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Conſider your waies:</hi> he meaneth an after conſideration of them, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the circumſtances of place. On the other ſide, the oppoſite neglect of this is blamed, as the cauſe of many and great evils, Jer. 8. 6. <hi>I hearkned and heard, and no man ſaid what have I done,</hi> &amp;c. Look as a curious Limner, or he that draweth a picture exactly, and to the life, often reviews what is done, where it agreeth, where it miſſeth, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten compareth it, and mendeth it as he ſeeth occaſion: even ſo muſt we that are to give an account of all our actions unto God, take an account of our ſelves and our own waies, and where we find any thing out of place and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95743:106"/> there to place it aright, and to undo it by true repentance, that ſo our after paths may be made ſtraight; This was <hi>Davids</hi> practiſe, Pſalm 119. 59. <hi>I conſidered my waies, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies;</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can there be any accurate lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our lives without this ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, out of all which there reſulteth one Uſe more of the Doctrine, which time will not give leave now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, namely a Uſe of Diſcovery upon the examination of our ſelves, and our waies, to wit, that if we find that the courſe of our lives hath been drawn, (though imperfectly) according to the forementioned rules, that the bent of our hearts was that way: and though we find not any abſolute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe in our carriages, without any ſwerving; yet if our conſciences bear us witneſſe, that we did ſhoot at this mark; this was our aim, and that we were ſorrie when we miſſed it, if we find a ſutableneſs and correſpondency in our lives unto Gods word, and humility of heart in our performance, we may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                  <p>THe ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Man after Gods own heart, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the former words deſired of God, that he would make him to know his end, and the meaſure of his
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95743:108"/> dayes: what it was, how fraile and fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of his life was, and thereupon duly acknowledging that his <hi>dayes were but a ſpan long,</hi> of four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth, and his very age was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſpectively to God. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thereupon, inferreth this doleful concluſion out of the former premiſes: <hi>Surely every man,</hi> &amp;c. Giving us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thereby, that the more any man doth ſeriouſly diſcern the frailty and fragility of his life, the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and aſſured he will grow of mans vanity. The Text, I confeſſe, is a moſt unpleaſing, but not unprofitable Subject, it being a diſgraceful deciphering of every man in his beſt condition: and we love not, you know, to hear of any thing that tendeth to our diſgrace, or the vilifying of us in our own conceits; yet it is very wholeſome and medecin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: the apprehenſion of our miſery being the firſt ſtep towards immortality. Twice it is repeated in this Pſalm for failing; <hi>verſe</hi> 5th. and the 11th. and in both places hemmed in with an aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of certainty; <hi>Surely:</hi> and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical <hi>Selah</hi> of animadverſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95743:108"/> with the one, pointed and ſealed with the other; the one prefixed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our incredulity in this matter; for it is hardly credited: The other annexed to prevent our negligence in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration hereof; for it is but ſmally regarded: both of them added to work a deep impreſſion of the matter upon our ſouls. Now for this Seraphical <hi>Selah,</hi> the ſeal of this Divine Aphoriſme, it importeth in the true ſupport thereof elevation: as you would ſay elevate: or loftily: which becauſe it is onely uſed in the ſacred meeter of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſome would have to be onely a muſical note, for the ſtrayning and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the voice in ſinging, as <hi>Ela</hi> is with us. Others not confining of it to the extenſion of the voice, take it to imply, a deeper attention of the mind, in pauſing upon the thing delivered: <hi>Selah,</hi> as you would ſay: See, Lo, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: and <hi>Tremelius</hi> renders it Maxime, as if it were a true and ſure Maxime in Law. The Chaldee Paraphraſe, and ſome of the Hebrews, have tranſlated <hi>for ever,</hi> noting the matter contained, to be of eternal and perpetual verity to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95743:109"/> the end of the world, for ever and ever. You may, if you pleaſe, take in all three, and joyne them together, and then are all inſtructed, that the matter averred, is a thing of weight and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, of infallible certainties, not to be queſtioned, and of moſt intentive conſideration, ſeriouſly to be medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on: and Gods Ambaſſadours may be encouraged to ſpeak hereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently: <hi>Surely:</hi> as a point of unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable infallibility: and with a <hi>Selah</hi> too: loftily lifting up their voices like trumpets, for the better rouſing up the ſecure hearts of the children of men, that are ſo much ſet upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>The words are in themſelves, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Propoſition, very ſhort, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full: the Propoſition is univerſal in both parts, both in reſpect of ſubject, and of the predicate: <hi>Omnis homo eſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa vanitas:</hi> ſo the vulgar: or <hi>Omni modo vanitas:</hi> ſo <hi>Tremelius:</hi> man and vanity are convertible, all man is all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and all vanity is in all and every man: Every word in the Text is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, each of them one ſtep or degree
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95743:109"/> further than another: the whole Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>max runneth thus: I <hi>man</hi> 2 <hi>every man</hi> 3 <hi>every man in his beſt eſtate</hi> 4 <hi>every man in his beſt eſtate for the preſent,</hi> not may be for the future, or was for time paſt: 5 <hi>every man in his beſt eſtate is vanity,</hi> 6 <hi>every man in his beſt eſtate is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity.</hi> Thus he is 7 <hi>Surely,</hi> 8 and with a <hi>Selah</hi> too: eight ſteps each a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, for the whole creation of inferiours to be ſubject to vanity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20, 22. as the Apoſtle notes, is not much: but for man the nobleſt of all, endued with reaſon and underſtanding, for man to be vanity, that is a great matter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, were ſome ſorts of men, and thoſe of the baſer rank onely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that were the leſſe: but for vanity to overſpread every individual, and that of all kinds: for every man without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, Noble, or ingnoble, rich or poor, male or female, juſt or ſinner: as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> gloſſeth on my Text; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference, to be vanity; this is more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, though it were the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every particular man: yet were
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95743:110"/> this vanity confined to him in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy onely, and childhood: or in his old age when he reacheth fourſcore years, when his dayes are but trouble and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or at his death alone, when all his thoughts and projects periſh, and duſt returneth to duſt: this were but a ſmall matter: But for every man in his beſt eſtate, even in the conſiſtency of his age, as ſome render the words, in the vigour of his ſtrength, the meridian and height of his glory; in the maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ripeneſſe of his judgement, in his beſt qualifications, to be vanity: this is a thing that may juſtly put us all to a ſtand, and work amazement in us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, were every man in his beſt eſtate but vain in the concrete; this were the leſſe: but for them all to be vanity in the abſtract; this is more full, more home.</p>
                  <p>Yet fiftly, this is more, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanity; but altogether vanity; that not a piece of vanity, but whole vanity in all the parts, kinds, and particulars thereof, (as lightneſſe, emptineſſe, changeableneſſe, falſity, deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95743:110"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be wholly predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, were it onely affirmed, that when he is in his beſt eſtate, he might upon the exchange of his eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come altogether vanity for the future, this were nothing ſo much: as for him even <hi>de preſenti,</hi> and whiles his beſt eſtate remaineth to be altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, which is one degree fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and worthy conſideration; the Pſalmiſt doth not ſpeak of man col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, but diſtributively: He doth not ſay, that all men, take them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joyntly, make all vanity, a piece of vanity being conferred by one, and a piece by another, and what is wanting in one, is in one whole lump ſupplied by the reſt: But every man in and by himſelf, ſingle them out one by one, and every one of them is an univerſe of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and thus he is with a <hi>Surely:</hi> all ſeeming probabilities to the contrary notwithſtanding: and laſtly with a <hi>Selah,</hi> too: a <hi>Noverint univerſi,</hi> Be it known to all men, and conſidered by them: So that theſe words are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95743:111"/> and ſum of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and of the worſt of evils, that are through the body of the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of man corrupted. But let us conſider more punctually of vanity: and of man, as alſo of the <hi>Surely,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>That every man is altogether: even at his beſt eſtate but vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vanity, faith righteous <hi>David,</hi> is that which is not any thing, or which ſoon <note place="margin">Vanity, what it is.</note> ceaſeth to be: as the breath and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours which ſoon vaniſh. It is the emptineſſe of the creature, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle explaineth it, by the <hi>bondage of corruption,</hi> Rom. 8. 20, 21. It is a word of large ſignification, and containeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it many particulars:</p>
                  <p>As firſt, emptineſſe oppoſed to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, man wanteth his filling up, there is nothing in him, but voidneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it importeth lightneſſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to weight, and ſolidity: whence is the phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 9. <hi>That the children of men are lighter than va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, changeableneſſe and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, oppoſite to conſtancy and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity: as if the Pſalmiſt had ſaid; <hi>Man</hi>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:95743:111"/> 
                     <hi>is of a vaniſhing and fleeting condition, ever changing, never remaining at one ſtay, Pſal.</hi> 144. 4.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it implyeth falſhood and deceit, oppoſed to verity. <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> writeth of a vain Grammarian, who profeſſed great skill in <hi>Saluſt. Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris</hi> meeting with him, and meaning to try his cunning, Demanded of him, what <hi>Saluſt</hi> meant by that ſpeech of his concerning <hi>Caius Lentulus</hi> that it was a queſtion <hi>Stolidior-ne eſſet an vanior:</hi> Whether he were more fooliſh, or more vain? The conceited Grammarian an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the knowledge which he took upon him, was in antient words, not in thoſe that were trite and vulgar, worn by uſe; and that he was more fooliſh than <hi>Lentulus,</hi> that did not know that theſe two words in <hi>Saluſt,</hi> vain and fooliſh, did import one and the ſame thing: <hi>Apollinaris</hi> replied, That in antient Learning, thoſe were called vain, not which were dullards and fools; but ſuch as were given to lying and treachery: And ſo in Scripture phraſe, vanity and a lye, are all one, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 9. and <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 4. the epithet of lying is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95743:112"/> aſcribed to vanity, they are ſtiled <hi>lying vanities.</hi> Nor is vanity a meer priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a bare want; but a poſitive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting evil; or at the leaſt, unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe and diſquietment are the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents upon vanity: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>All is but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and there is no profit in them under the Sun:</hi> where you have all three of them joyned together. By this it may appear what is affirmed of man, when he is ſaid to be vanity. <hi>Every man in his beſt eſtate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Every man is vanity:</hi> What Chriſt and all, ſaith an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on my Text? not ſo: but as it is in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> every <hi>Adam,</hi> from himſelf, to the very laſt perſon that ſhall deſcend of him, according to the courſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary propagation: be he high or low, rich or poor, male or female: ſo far forth as he ſpringeth from <hi>Adam;</hi> and ſo far forth as the old <hi>Adam</hi> remaineth in him, he is but vanity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. But if you conſider him in the Second <hi>Adam, who of God is made unto us, wiſdom, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſanctification,</hi> and <hi>redemption:</hi> and in whom he is renewed unto the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95743:112"/> Image of God, wherein he was formerly created, then the caſe is quite altered, &amp; he is one of an holy excellency. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. 3<hi rend="sup">dy</hi>, every man at his beſt eſtate is vanity; conſider him paſſing through all his ages; not only in his infancy &amp; childhood, not only in his old age, when the years draw nigh; that he ſaith, <hi>I have no pleaſure in them;</hi> but vanity he is in his flouriſhing youth, and ripe &amp; mature manhood, vain in his life, vain in his death, and diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Conſider him in all his conditions, in all his employments: a very embleme of vanity; not only <hi>Haman</hi> in his decay and downfal, but <hi>Salomon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in all his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, is but vanity; inferiour to the very Lilly in the judgement of our Saviour. Fourthly, <hi>altogether vanity;</hi> all that is in him, or is his, is but vanity, and all vanity is in him, all the ſorts and kinds of vanity whatſoever: <hi>from the very crown of his head, unto the ſoles of his feet, there is nothing in him, but wounds and putrified ſores, full of corruption:</hi> his heart is a Sea of vanity, deceitful above all things, his ratiocinations, his imaginations vain, and even evil from his youth up, and continually; his very
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95743:113"/> tongue is a world of iniquity, all his parts and powers compoſed as it were of vanity: the holy Prophet making a full diſtribution of all humane good things, and referring them to three heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The goods of the mind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of fortune as they are called, or of the external condition layeth a kind of vanity upon them all, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empteth them all, from our glorying, or rejoycing in. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom,</hi> yet is that the beſt eſtate of the mind? <hi>let not the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength;</hi> yet that is the beſt eſtate of the body: <hi>neither let the rich man glory in his riches;</hi> yet that is the beſt eſtate of fortune, as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call it: <hi>but let him that glorieth, glory in that he underſtandeth, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me that I am the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the ſurety or confirmation of this, it is as certain, and as ſure as the Scripture can make it, the ſecond ſon of man, that was born into the world, did carry the very name and appellation of vanity; for he was called <hi>Habel;</hi>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:95743:113"/> that is, vanity: but the truth of the thing it ſelf agreeth to every mothers child, no leſſe than unto him; every <hi>Adam</hi> is <hi>Habel</hi> in my Text: I might refer you for the proof of this point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes;</hi> where again and again, and yet the third time; of all things, of all perſons; it is avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that vanity of vanites, they are all but vanity, there is no profit in them under the Sun:</hi> but the moſt pathetical to this you have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 9. where you have a <hi>Surely</hi> fixed before it too. <hi>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are as a lye:</hi> to be laid in the ballance, <hi>they are altogether lighter then vanity;</hi> where not only the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and thoſe of an inferiour rank, but even the ſons of <hi>Iſh:</hi> of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and potent perſons, both ſorts of them, <hi>are vanity:</hi> if there be any oddes or difference betwixt them, herein it conſiſteth, that the greater, the better, are in the worſt caſe; by how much a lye is worſe then vanity: poor mens vanity is engraven in their wants, written with greater characters in their outward miſerable conditions, ſo that every one
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95743:114"/> may read it, they appear to be what they are; but for great and noble perſons, (by reaſon of their glorious outſide,) they ſeem to be otherwiſe, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no leſſe vanity than the other; their vanity is not ſo tranſparent, but diſguiſed and hidden under outward pomp, and in this reſpect, as alſo becauſe we promiſe our ſelves (in our ſelves) ſo much from them, &amp; our expectations are ſo often, and ſo fouly diſppointed, they are rightly ſaid to be a lye. And mark what followeth; to be layed in the ballance, <hi>they are altogether lighter then vanity;</hi> vanity, which is lightneſſe it ſelf, doth over-weigh them; and that by reaſon of ſin in them, which being a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vanity, and the cauſe, muſt needs turn the ſcales, and lift up the natural vanity, which is the effect: this point may be further confirmed by the manifold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances in Scripture; man being ſtill compared to the vaineſt, emptieſt, lighteſt things that are. Whether hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, earthly, or humane; of all the heavenly things, he is reſembled to the wind, which is but a blaſt, a fume, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, a miſt: to a cloud, and darkneſs;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95743:114"/> ſo likewiſe compared to the baſeſt of all earthly things, to a beaſt that periſheth, to a ſhadow, a bubble, the froſt, things moſt flitting, and amongſt humane things to a tale, a ſheperds tent, a poſt, a weavers ſhuttle, a dream, than which nothing is vainer. Yea it is ſaid, that all the nations of the world put them together, are leſſe then nothing, reſpectively to God, in whom is no darkneſſe, nor degree of vanity: many ſuch alluſions do every where almoſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the ſacred page: the truth of which, our daily experience doth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ratifie: for howſoever in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, men are ſo made drunk with ſenſual pleaſures, that neither they do diſcern, nor feel themſelves vanity; yet in afflictions and miſeries, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to open their eyes, and to confeſſe, that all is but vanity: the heathens, though ignorant of the true cauſe of this, yet by the very light of nature ſaw a glimpſe hereof, whence ſome of them delivered, that it was beſt for men not to be born, and the next ſoon to dye. And do we not come weeping and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, into the world? Do we not live in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95743:115"/> it toyling and moyling; eaten up with care, diſtracted with feares, and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a thouſand griefs. Dye we not groaning, hath not vanity ſeiſed upon all eſtates, conditions, enterpriſes; our bodies they are weak, our form fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile, our healths uncertain, our lives flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and poſting away, our hopes often diſappointed; our friends inconſtant, or or mortal at the beſt; our honours faigned, or failing; our underſtandings blind, our wills perverſe, our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons turbulent, our ſenſes ſubject to many deceits; our whole man depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; our offices burdenſome, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits bewitching, our ſtrength vain, which muſt become as water ſpilt upon the ground: Is not favour deceitful, and beauty but vanity: <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31. 30. which muſt be turned into rottenneſſe, and loathſomneſſe; our pleaſure mixt, and unſincere: yea, our very thoughts and imaginations which are the very <hi>ſirſt-born of the ſoule,</hi> and are the hinges, upon which all our other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do turn: the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the children of men, that they are vain; yea, all over man is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95743:115"/> as empty as the wind; as flitting as the miſt in the ayre, ſo vain a thing is man; that he cannot adde one inch unto his ſtature; nor alter the colour of one hair of his head, nor keep off one judgement of God, nor protract his time one minute. Vain in himſelf, and all other things vain to him; who being a microcoſme, or little world, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth within himſelf the whole great world of vanity. So that all the ſeveral vanities which are diſperſed here and there throughout the other creatures, are in him united in one, and ſo do meet in him, as in their common cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and firſt original: he is a very map of vanity.</p>
                  <p>But how cometh this to paſſe, did <note place="margin">The ground of the point.</note> not the Almighty at the firſt creation, make all things good, <hi>and ſaw them to be exceeding good in their kindes;</hi> whence then are theſe lawes? how came in this vanity? <hi>Surely the envious enemy hath done this,</hi> for vanity is not the fruit of Gods creation, but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of mans prevarication: God made <hi>Adam</hi> in his own image, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95743:116"/> him as a noble vine, but he turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine; it came in then through the wili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the old Serpent, and by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, In whom we all ſinned; and ſo the excellency becommeth blaſted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were firſt created; and vanity hath ſeiſed upon man firſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21. And ſecondarily upon the other creatures. The Creature, ſaith the Apoſtle, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto vanity: not of its own will, that is, not by any voluntary defection, or ſin in it ſelf, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubdued it under hope; that is, by the juſt judgement of God; who for the ſin of man, hath ſubdued it into vanity: under the hope of reſtitution and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from this vanity, which there the Apoſtle calleth the bondage of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but now on the other ſide, man is ſubject unto vanity of his own will, and by his voluntary falling away from God: from whence it followeth, that man is vainer then all the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; not onely becauſe he was the beſt and nobleſt of them, and <hi>Corruptio optimi eſt peſſima;</hi> as the ſweeteſt wine becomes the ſowreſt vinegar, but alſo
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95743:116"/> becauſe he was the cauſe of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the other creatures; and that which maketh other things ſo, that muſt needs be more ſo in it ſelfe: the vanity of the other creatures is but natural and ſinleſſe, as being not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it: the vanity of man is moral, the other creatures are ſenſible of their vanity, and groaning under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, by the very inſtinct of nature ſeek out for a remedy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. but man, though he be the vaineſt of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet is not affected with his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, feeleth it not; and ſo ſeeketh no redreſſe from under it, but even ſports himſelfe in it, as if vanity were his felicity, the vanity of other creatures extendeth but to time at fartheſt: it endeth in their death or diſſolution, but the vanity that is in man, preſſeth him down to hell, and (without Gods great mercy interpoſing) reacheth to eternity, and even then beginneth moſt; when the other creatures va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity doth ceaſe. And, to conclude, beſides the proper ſtock which he hath of his own, he communicateth
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:95743:117"/> in the ſeveral vanities of all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar creatures, and may juſtly be ſtiled, <hi>vanity of vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is full time, (me thinks) to <note place="margin">Firſt uſe.</note> look homewards, and to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, we will therfore make a pawſe here, and affixe the <hi>Selah:</hi> It is a high point of wiſdome to get ſome good even out of that which is evil, and hereby we approach nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto God in perfection, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore derive the Soveraigne vertue of this truth unto our own ſouls, in the ſundry and ſeverall occaſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and firſt this may be uſeful to take downe all proud conceits in man, that advance themſelves againſt Chriſt, to abate our loſtineſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to avile us all in our own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and to lay us low in our own eyes; even unto ſelfe-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence.</p>
                  <p>Methinkes the ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this point and the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beliefe of the truth hereof, that vanity is fixed even in our very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that it ſticks not in notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95743:117"/> ſinners, and deboſhed perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but ſpreadeth it ſelfe to all <hi>Adam,</hi> to every Mothers ſonne, not one excepted, no not thoſe that have the beſt natures, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſpoſitions; methinks I ſay that this ſhould deeply humble us in our ſelves, and take away that ſelf-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, which undoeth many a ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is uſefull for to provoke, to ſet a higher price on all the bleſſings of God beſtowed on us, and to endeare his bounty and goodneſſe towards us, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, to ſet an edge upon our thankfulneſſe: conſidering our own little worth: and that we are but vanity: and ſurely then there can be no deſert of his ſavours, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 144. 3. <hi>what is man Lord that thou takeſt knowledge of him, or the Son of man that thou makeſt ſuch account of him?</hi> and there the Prophet ſhewes the grounds of his wonderment: <hi>man is like to vanity, his dayes are as a ſhadow that paſſeth away,</hi> &amp;c. and certainly,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95743:118"/> Gods gifts are never ſo right valued, when they are conſidered alone by themſelves, as when they are view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed joyntly together, with our own wretchedneſſe. <hi>I am leſſe:</hi> ſayes Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: <hi>then the leaſt of all thy mercies;</hi> his own indignity did ſet a luſtre upon Gods ſmalleſt mercies: <hi>Et dare non dignis res mage digna Deo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from hence the inference of the Scripture is forcible, and very prevailing; that ſeeing every man is vanity, that therefore we ſettle not our truſt, or repoſe our confidence in any ſon of man, be he never ſo great; for then we do but make falſhood our refuge, and under vanity are we hid: <hi>we lean on broken reeds, that will pierce us through.</hi> See for this at large, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62. 6, 7, 8, 9. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 146. 34. where the charge is ſet on with many enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing conſiderations, which for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake I omit. Even Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not to be truſted in; the duty that we owe to our ſuperious, is faithfulneſſe and obedience, not truſt and confidence.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:95743:118"/>
                  <p> It ſhall be found true, that never any perſons ſmarted more in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of their expectations, then thoſe that relyed moſt ſtrongly on morall men. Again, gather we ſome ſweet out of this ſowre, that every man in his beſt eſtate is <hi>altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Uſe we this truth to our conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as our humiliations; and the comfort lyeth eſpecially in three particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when we have potent enemies, which are too ſtrong for us, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our undoing; when we begin to be terrified, and diſmayed, this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may be a ſtay to us, and cleare our ſpirits then, be they never ſo great; yet at the beſt they are but vanity, and can do neither good nor hurt of themſelves: thus the Prophet at large. <hi>Eſay</hi> 51. 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man, that ſhall dye; and of the Son of man, that ſhall be made as graſſe, I, even I, am he that comfort you,</hi> &amp;c. it is preſſed there more at large.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may comfort us in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95743:119"/> reſpect of our own infirmities, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane weakneſſes; for by this vanity of ours, and frailty, we become fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for Gods pity and commiſeration; for what glory ſhall he get by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with us that are too weak for him; thus holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 103. 13. 14. that the Lord knoweth our mould, and frame, that we are but duſt; and thereupon, <hi>as a Father pitieth his child, ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on them that feare him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to accommodate this to the preſent occaſion, this may ſerve as a Cordial to moderate our grief in the loſſe of our deareſt and nobleſt friends, for who are they that are dead and gone? Surely, whether they were of high or low degree, they were but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and now they are dead, there is an end of their vanity, rather then of themſelves; their vanity is gone, but their excellency remaineth with them: there is but one, and that is the laſt piece of their vanity which remaineth, which is the captivity of their bodies under the grave, and the turning of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95743:119"/> it into rottenneſſe, but yet they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of it, and feel no pain; and being for ever bleſſed in the preſence and fruition of God himſelfe; they do live in the certain and aſſured expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the re-union of their bodies, with their ſoules: and therefore I ſay with the bleſſed Apoſtle, in the very ſame caſe. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Comfort your ſelves one another with theſe words:</hi> and ſo for a time I will lay aſide my Text and betake my ſelf to the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; of which, that very ſpectacle doth mind us.</p>
                  <p>And now give me leave for a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my Text, a little to invert the words; and what the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of every <hi>Adam,</hi> by way of contraries, to apply to every true Chriſtian; and that is this: Every true Chriſtan, even in his worſt eſtate, is altogether excellent; this is the difference of our being in the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> In the one alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity, in the other altogether excellent; excellent in their life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in their death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 8. <hi>for if they live, they live unto the Lord, and</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:95743:120"/> 
                     <hi>if they dye, they dye, unto the Lord; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they live or dye, they are the Lords:</hi> take them in their worſt eſtates, even in afflictions, and there they rejoyce under the hope of the glory of God: and their affliction which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, worketh a far ſuper-excellent, and an eternal weight of glory: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. afflicted on every ſide, but not forſaken, caſt down, but they periſh not; come what can come, come what may; <hi>yet are they in all things more then conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and every thing turneth to their good.</hi> Rom. 8. 23. And, as it followeth in the ſame place, <hi>neither life, nor death, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall be able to ſeparate them from the love of God; which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord:</hi> and therefore as <hi>Salomon</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> after his large diſcourſe of vanity, for a concluſion of all; <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes</hi> 12. 13. brings in the remedy; and the counterpoyſe of vanity, even ſo ſay I with him: let us hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the whole matter: <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandements; for this is</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:95743:120"/> 
                     <hi>the whole duty of man.</hi> Aſſure your ſelves, there is nothing that eates up vanity, but grace onely: and ſo much the more grace, ever ſo much the leſſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: <hi>All things under the Sun are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> but onely grace: and therefore let all our prayers and endeavours be ſet on this; to have Grace to ſerve God in this world, that we may have glory, the reward of our ſervice in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Now to God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the Holy Ghoſt, be rendred all Honour, and Glory, both now, and evermore. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

                  <p>THe things whereof we are to examine our ſelves, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to two heads, our Sins, and our Graces.</p>
                  <p>The neceſſity of the examination of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95743:122"/> our ſins appears in this, That ſins unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined are uneſpied: being uneſpied, they will be unrepented; being unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, we ſhall bring them with us to the Sacrament: and being brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us to the Sacrament, or the Lords Table, they will be a Bar to the confirmation of Gods Covenant with us, whereof the Bread and Wine is a Seal, and alſo to our reaping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſweetneſſe and benefits of that Ordinance: for where there is no ſearching and trying of our waies: there can be no turning unto the Lord, Lam. 3. 40.</p>
                  <p>Now there are four principal helps to further, us in the examination of our ſins.</p>
                  <p>1. A diſtribution of our lives into certain portions, according to our ages of childhood, youth, manhood, old age, and it will be uſeful for us ſeverally, to remember: So much of my time I ſpent in my fathers family, under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my parents: ſo much time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, under the care and tuition of others, and theſe and theſe ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, during that ſame time: ſuch a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95743:122"/> quantity of time ſpent in the ſervice of others; and ſuch a portion being a free man, at my own liberty: ſo many years paſſed over in a ſingle eſtate, ſo many in Matrimonie or Wedlock. This diſtribution of our lives into certain portions, will help us to a diſcovery of our particular ſins, and the aggravation of them from our nativitie to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment, wherein we begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelves. Whereas without this our apprehenſions and view of them will be but confuſed, onely in groſſe and in general. But when we have thus quartered our lives, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered thoſe ſpecial ſins, that have been committed by us, in thoſe ſeveral diviſions, the main ſins of our lives will appear in a kind of order before us. Yet we are ſtill to remember, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe greater and more eminent ſins of our lives which appear; there will be many unknown ſins: many omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of good duties, many ſlender per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of our beſt duties diſcharged, which will eſcape our ſearch.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:95743:123"/>
                  <p> The ſecond help will be to ſet before us the glaſſe of Gods Law ſum'd up in the ten Commandments, <hi>for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> Rom. 3. 20. in which glaſſe we muſt conſider the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and extent of every command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how far it reacheth in the ſeveral prohibitions of evil, and precepts of good, for Gods Commandments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad, Pſal. 119. 96. if thus we ſhall do with heedfulneſſe, then we ſhall ſee our faces in the glaſſe of Gods Law to the full, and our own ſpots and wrinkles, and we ſhall find thoſe things upon our review, to be ſins, which in acting of them, (it may be) we deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be none: and underſtand what <hi>Paul</hi> meant, Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not known ſin but by the Law, for I had not known luſt, except it had been ſaid, thou ſhalt not covet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third help is, a conſideration of the heightning circumſtances of ſin, the aggravating conditions, whereby our ſins may appear unto us (as too often they are) exceeding ſinful, for we ought to examine the heinouſneſſe of our impieties, as well as the multitude.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95743:123"/> This will cauſe our humiliation to be deeper, our ſorrow to be heartier, and engage us more feelingly to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto God for his great love in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of them through Chriſt. See this pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tiſe by <hi>Peter</hi> upon his denial, Mark 14. 72. <hi>Peter called to mind the word that Jeſus ſaid unto him; before the Cock crow thou ſhalt deny me thrice:</hi> The aggravating circumſtances of his ſin helped on to draw out his tears with bitterneſſe: The holy man might think with himſelf, What have I done? How great is my ſin? Did I not lately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe never to forſake my Maſter? no not if all men elſe ſhould forſake him, yet I would never leave him? And am I the man that denies him ſo ſoon? I that am ſo near related to him, as his Diſciple, ſo eminently preferred by him as his Apoſtle; not compeld by any in authority, but frighted to it by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a woman ſervant? Was not my ſin great enough to deny him once? but have I done it twice and thrice? Might I not have denied him barely with ſin enough, but muſt I forſwear him too? I was not ſurpriſed at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95743:124"/> but forewarned, and but even now forewarned, by my Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whoſe words I ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, &amp;c. Thus he called to mind the word that Jeſus ſaid unto him, <hi>and he went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the aggravating circumſtances of ſin are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the dignitie of the perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, the more eminent the perſon, the more vile the ſin. Now the dignity is either external or internal: external in reſpect of ſome high place, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, authority, employment or truſt, whereunto a man is advanced, as to be a Magiſtrate, Miniſter, Father, Maſter: and ſhould ſuch a man as I fly? ſaid that good Magiſtrate <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> its intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in one of my rank or place; the Lord will look to be ſanctified in thoſe that draw near him in place and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: ſo likewiſe an internal dignitie, of grace or gifts, heightens the ſin of any perſon, a lighter ſin in them whom God hath made his ſons by adoption, is (in ſme ſot) greater then in unregenerate men, <hi>though Iſrael play the harlot, yet Judah muſt not offend, Hoſ.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:95743:124"/>
                  <p> The ſecond thing that aggravates our ſins, is the ſpecialties of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: where God is more bountiful, the ſin is more inexcuſable, in that he is not drawn with the cords of Gods love: and this you may ſee 2 Sam. 12. 7. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> brings in a Catalogue of Gods mercies and favours ſhewed to <hi>David,</hi> God anointed him King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> delivered him out of the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> gave him his Lords houſe, and his Lords wives into his boſom, and thereupon infers the grievouſneſſe of his ſin, v. 9. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou then deſpiſed the Commandement of the Lord to do evil in his ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third circumſtance of aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is outward ſcandal given by our ſins, when we have not onely ſinned perſonally, but given offence unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; if we ſad the hearts of the righteous, ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked; if we give occaſion to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God to blaſpheme, cauſe our profeſſion to be evil ſpoken of, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome mens manners, indangering others, laying a ſtumbling block before the weak, troubling their conſciences,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95743:125"/> perverting their judgements, ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the truth, and theſe things make our ſins ſcandalous. Now this is certain, the further corruption ſpreads, and the more the ſent thereof poyſons others, the more odious it is to God, and ſhould be more odious unto men: no ſinnes more damnable then theirs, who enter not into the Kingdom of heaven themſelves, nor by their wills would ſuffer others to enter: who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low others to go to hell which way they will, and ſuffer them not to go to Heaven that way which they ſhould.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing which adds to the weight of ſin, is continuance and delight in ſin: unto ſome ſins we give fuller conſent of will, we pleaſe our ſelves in them more, we lye longer in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance: ſuch were the ſins of <hi>David</hi> in his murther and adulterie, he committed many other ſins, but theſe his conſcience did not chide him for, of a long time: theſe put his ſoul into a diſtemper, and made ſuch a ſpoil and havock of his graces, that he ſtood in need of a new Creation, a new and freſh
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95743:125"/> infuſion of grace, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within me,</hi> Pſal. 51. 10. and they ſtripped him of the joy of the holy Ghoſt, v. 12. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me unto the joy of thy ſalvation.</hi> Continuance and delight in ſin, break down the fences of grace, and lay all waſt, ſo that the whole man is out of frame, he cannot ſet himſelf upon good duties, but lies open unto ſinne.</p>
                  <p>To theſe may be added as aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our own profeſſion that we have made formerly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our covenants and promiſes made unto God in baptiſm, and many times ſince upon occaſions, of deliverance from danger, of being heard in our requeſts, of hope of mercy in our low eſtate: this makes our treſpaſſes double iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as being not onely ſins againſt Gods precepts, but alſo breaches of our own promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The means of grace received; for where grace is offered more plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and rejected, ſin is more ſinful, Luke 12. 48. theſe means are partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95743:126"/> as wit, memory, knowledge, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, and the like, partly outward, as the preaching of the word, and other ordinances of God, the light of good examples and other reſtraints from the laws of Chriſtian Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>The fourth help to further us in the examination of our ſins, is, to pray unto God to give us his ſpirit to be our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer to call to our minds thoſe ſins which are ſlipt out of our memories, to recal the ſins of our youth, and other ages, which we have attained unto: and as he ſhewed to the Prophet by degrees greater and greater abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the houſe of Iſrael, Ezek 8. 6. 13. 15. even ſo that he would diſcry to us by little and little the abominations of our own lives: ſo prayed that holy man <hi>Job</hi> 13. 23. <hi>How many are mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and ſins, make me to know my tranſgreſſion and my ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much of the firſt head, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our ſins, now follows the ſecond head concerning the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our graces. The neceſſity whereof appears.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe we muſt bring grace
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95743:126"/> with us to the Sacrament, or elſe we ſhall ſcarſely bring grace from thence: we muſt come to Chriſts Table to have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces confirmed and enlarged: now it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to have them in us afore hand, for there is no confirmation of that which is not reſident in us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe otherwiſe we may take the ſemblance of grace for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and may be deceived with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſhews and ſhadows for currant graces.</p>
                  <p>Now the principal graces whereof we are to examine our ſelves are four.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Knowledge.</item>
                     <item>Faith.</item>
                     <item>Repentance.</item>
                     <item>Charitie.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>We are to examine our knowledge, firſt for the ſubſtance of it: ſecondly for the ſincerity of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for the ſubſtance: Whether we know God, whom to know is eternal life, John 17. 2. whether we apprehend by faith what we cannot comprehend
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95743:127"/> by reaſon the unity of the Godhead in Trinitie of perſons, John. 5. 7. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we know his eſſence and eſſential properties, Exod. 34. 6. What we know of Chriſt in whom we believe, what of his natures, as God and Man, of his Perſon, as the Son of God, of his Offices, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet; of his Life, Death, and Reſurrection, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are to know our ſelves firſt as originally created in <hi>Adam,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with Gods image, Eccleſ. 7. 31. God made man righteous. Secondly as by ſin and diſobedience we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture children of wrath, and that the frame and thoughts of our hearts are onely evil, and that continually, Gen. 6. 5. Thirdly, <hi>as by grace and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are renewed in holineſs and righteouſneſſe, after the image of him that created us,</hi> Eph. 4. 24.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt know the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and how it is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Covenant of works, by this God requires perfect obedience. <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all things, that are written in the Law to</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:95743:127"/> 
                     <hi>do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. But by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> Gal. 3. 11. in this Covenant of Grace God promiſeth life, if we obey as in the other Covenant, but withal he gives faith and obedience that we may live: he promiſeth to put his fear in our hearts, and that he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, and that we ſhall not depart from him. Jerem 32. 40. and ch. 31. 33.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we are to know the nature of a Sacrament: That it is a viſible ſign of inviſible graces repreſented thereby: That it is a ſeal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt God and us. Rom. 4. 11. for tis there called a ſeal of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of faith: ſo was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo is Baptiſme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Again, we muſt underſtand the Analogie and proportion betwixt the outward ſign, and the inward graces ſignified. That the Bread ſignifieth the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and being ſet apart for holy uſe, they alſo ſignifie, the deſignment of Chriſt by God the Father, unto the Office of Mediatour,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95743:128"/> John 6. 26. for him hath the Father ſealed: the Bread broken, and the Wine poured out, the actual crucifying of Chriſt. The tradition of it by the Miniſter unto us, ſignifieth both the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of Chriſt to death by the Father, and the reaching of him out unto us in that Ordinance; and that by Bread and Wine, whole Chriſt is repreſented with all his graces and benefits. It is our duty further to underſtand the ends of the Celebration of the Sacrament, both principal that it muſt be done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him for the ſhewing forth of his death until he come, Luke 22. 19. 1 Cor. 1. 23. Leſſe principal that we may have ſealed unto us all the benefits of his death as ours, Rom. 4. 11.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoever is a ſtranger unto theſe things, cannot be a good Communicant, he is not able to diſcern the Lords body, 1 Cor. 11. 29. Nor is his heart right without this knowledge, there will be ſome evil uneſpied, and lurking in the heart.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:95743:128"/>
                  <p> And when we have examined our knowledge for ſubſtance, we muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly examine the ſincerity of it: it is not ſufficient that we know, unleſſe our knowledge be ſanctified, which muſt be tryed by theſe grounds:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A ſanctified knowledge hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the Owner, it makes our ſpots and blemiſhes perſpicuous to our ſelves: the more we know, the more we diſcern our ſelves to be ignorant. This is clear in <hi>Paul;</hi> there was not a man more rarely accompliſht with all kinde of knowledge than he: there lived not upon the face of the earth, a more humble ſoul: he was in his own judgement, <hi>the leaſt of all Saints, Ephe.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>the greateſt of ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 16 The Scribes and Phariſees on the other ſide, knew much, and were great Scholars; but their knowledge was not ſincere, becauſe it <hi>puffed them up,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 1. they ſcorned to learn any thing of others: <hi>John</hi> 9. 34. <hi>Thou art,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>altogether born in ſin, and doſt thou teach us?</hi> Again, they ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others that were ignorant; and therefore they ſay, <hi>This people that</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:95743:129"/> 
                     <hi>know not the Law are accurſed.</hi> It ſeems they were highly conceited of their own knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Where knowledge is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, the mind is impartial to all truths: ſuch a perſon doth not hood-wink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and will not ſee ſome truths; as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of ſome that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ignorant of ſome truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>they would not ſee ſome things to be ſin, becauſe they reſolved to continue in them.</hi> This is <hi>a deteining the truth in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a man of a ſanctified knowledg, is like <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10. 33. <hi>ready to hear all things commanded of God;</hi> though they croſs his opinions, or affections, interrupt his pleaſures, or draw ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency upon him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A holy and ſincere know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, may be known by the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: practiſe is the end of ſincere knowledge: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy name, will put their truſt in thee.</hi> Some deſire to know, and onely to know, and that is vanity: ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know, that they may be known to know, and that is curioſity: ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95743:129"/> knowledge to make a gain of it, that's mercenary coveteouſneſſe: But ſome deſire knowledge that it may be a guide to their affections, a directive of their actions, and that they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their light to others: and this is true Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Grace to be examined, is our faith. Faith is a reſting on Gods Promiſes, and Chriſts merits for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In a juſtifying faith, there are four acts included. The firſt is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the word, which Chriſt would have his give credit unto: as this, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth on Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> 2, An aſſent of the mind unto the truth which God ſpeaks. Of theſe ſomewhat hath been ſpoken before. The 3d. act of faith whereon conſiſts our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is a reſting of the heart upon Gods word, eſpecially his promiſes of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, a claſping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them with our affections, reſolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to caſt all our hopes upon them. And hence it is, that the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes faith under ſuch termes as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a rolling our ſelves in Chriſt: hence
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95743:130"/> a ſoul goes out of it ſelf, and <hi>puts on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and deſires to be found in him,</hi> Philip. 3. He is willing to be naked as to the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and to be found in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt. This is hard work for natural men; for ſuch think that for their good intentions, and good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their unblameable civility, they ſhall go to Heaven; though in words they profeſſe they look to be ſaved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Chriſt. Moreover, he that reſts upon Chriſt fot juſtification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will reſt upon Chriſt for direction; for he believes Chriſt is wiſdom unto him, and he will reſt upon him for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification alſo; for he believes Chriſt hath purchaſed holineſſe for him, and will give it him; becauſe Chriſt is made unto us of God, <hi>both wiſdom to teach us,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe to juſtifie us,</hi> and <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification to hallow us,</hi> and <hi>redemption to ſave us,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. Finally, faith reſts upon Chriſt in all eſtates, in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity as well as in proſperity. When we cannot diſcern God a loving Father by things that are ſeen, faith goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond things viſible, unto <hi>thoſe things</hi>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:95743:130"/> 
                     <hi>that are not ſeen,</hi> and fetcheth evidence home to the ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be confident in proſperity: but faith will rely and reſt upon God when God ſeems to kill: when ſenſe and reaſon can ſee nothing but death and hell: yet faith will believe God a Father, and Heaven prepared for the poor ſoul. The 4th act of Faith is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: by it we do appropriate Gods general promiſes unto our own ſouls, and claim a particular right and intereſt in Chriſts blood: ſaying with <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>VVho loved me, and gave himſelf for me;</hi> with <hi>Thomas, My Lord, and my God,</hi> Joh. 20. For the trial of our right application, take this one Rule. A right application doth not onely bring home Gods grants and promiſes unto us, but the conditions alſo that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our part: He that will be ſaved, muſt not onely believe with the heart, but alſo <hi>confeſſe with the mouth,</hi> Ro. 10. that <hi>without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. The want of this was the fault of the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 8, 9. They laid hold on Gods Covenant made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed: but
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95743:131"/> never obſerved Gods conditions impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them. The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> adviſeth them <hi>not to ſay they had Abraham to their father;</hi> but to do the workes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to perform the condition on their parts, <hi>and to bring forth fruits meet for Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus muſt our faith be examined, and there is great need ſo to examine our ſelves: becauſe, 1. God enjoynes it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Prove your ſelves whether that ye be in the faith.</hi> 2. Becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, <hi>there is no pleaſing of God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. 3. Becauſe it is the chief inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are to uſe in the Sacrament, for the applying of Chriſt and all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. It is the eye by which we ſee Chriſt, the hand by which we receive him, the mouth and the ſtomack by which we feed upon him.</p>
                  <p>The third Grace to be examined, is Repentance, a needful grace to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: Firſt becauſe we come to the Lords Table to receive by ſeal, as it were, the forgiveneſſe of our ſins; and therefore 'tis fit we repent of them, and be ſorrowful for them: Prov. 28. 13.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95743:131"/> 
                     <hi>He that covereth his ſin ſhall not proſper, but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy.</hi> 2. Penitents finde acceptance at Gods Table, as thoſe that are dreſſed and apparelled for a Feaſt: and uſually according to the meaſure of our humiliation, do we receive the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of conſolation. 3. Repentance will quicken our appetites for the Lords Table, and the uſe of it, as ſower herbs did for the Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p>Now in Repentance we ſhall finde two parts: firſt a mournful recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our former errours: ſecondly a chearful reformation of our future lives: It beginneth in ſorrow, it ends in joy. The firſt part is ſet down <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 9. <hi>A turning unto the Lord with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning:</hi> The ſecond part, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Bring forth fruits meet for repentance.</hi> Humiliation without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is a foundation without a building: Reformation without Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, is a building without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>And where ſorrow for ſin is ſincere, it hath theſe 4. properties, it is, 1. Godly
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95743:132"/> for the nature; 2. Hearty, for the meaſure; 3. Conſtant, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; 4. Quickening, for the effect.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt, there is a godly and a worldly ſorrow, as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. It is termed <hi>godly ſorrow,</hi> becauſe reſpect unto God cauſeth it. When grief in us doth ſpring from this, that we have offended a God that is moſt holy in himſelf: as a God that hath been ſo many wayes good and gratious unto us: Whereas worldly ſorrow is occaſioned by ſome worldly reſpect of ſhame, or fear of danger.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It muſt be hearty for the meaſure: the heart muſt be <hi>rent,</hi> Joel 2. the ſpirit muſt be <hi>broken,</hi> Pſal. 51. 17. We muſt lament for our ſins, <hi>as a man mourns for the loſſe of his own child,</hi> Zech. 12. 10, 11. a ſlight and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial grief, will not ſerve the turn.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It muſt be conſtant, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, not for a time, but renewed every morning and evening: <hi>Davids ſins were ever before him,</hi> Pſal. 51. 3. yea, if it were poſſible, we ſhould ſo
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95743:132"/> grieve for ſins paſt, that we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſin hereafter; but ſpend our lives in ſorrow and contrition for ſins already done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It muſt be ſuch a ſorrow, as quickeneth to holy duties, as prayer, hearing of the word, and the like. Worldly ſorrow makes us lumpiſh; but ſpiritual and godly ſorrow ſuppleth the heart, and makes it nimble <hi>to run the wayes of Gods Commandment:</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11. Behold this ſame thing, <hi>that ye ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed after a godly ſort: what carefulneſs it wrought in you? yea, what clearing of your ſelves? yea, what indignation? yea, what fear? yea, what vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? yea, what zeal? yea, what revenge?</hi> Mark, here are ſeven gratious effects of ſincere Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Further, we may try our Repentance by thoſe ordinary ſteps or ſtaires of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by which Gods children aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to this grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſearching and trying our wayes, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sight of ſin after ſearching, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 3. <hi>I know mine iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:95743:133"/> 3. Feeling of the burden of them after ſight: <hi>this is to be weary and heavy laden,</hi> Mat. 11. 28.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Humbly confeſſing of them, with <hi>grief of heart, and ſhame of face,</hi> Dan. 9. 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hateing and deteſting them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving never to commit them any more: ſo <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. <hi>What have I any more to do with idols?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Power and conqueſt over them for the time to come: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>I kept my ſelf from mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Grace to be examined is Charity. The neceſſity of our exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Grace appeareth:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God will not have us offer the Sacrifice of Piety upon his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, until <hi>Reconciliation be made with our brother,</hi> Mat 5. 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are forbidden to keep this Feaſt <hi>with the leaven of malitiouſneſs; but with the unleavened bread of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and truth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>Now for the right examination of our Charity.</p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:95743:133"/>
                  <p> Firſt, It muſt be eſpecially affectionate to the ſoul of our brother: <hi>My hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they may be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10. 1. Be we never ſo rich in almes-deeds, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and inoffenſive in our outward carriage: yet never truly charitable to men, till we affect and ſeek their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, True charity is to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, as well as to the inward: It joyneth beneficence to benevolence: it doth not onely wiſh well, but do well: 'tis bountiful externally, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly affectionate: <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 15, 16. <hi>If a brother or ſiſter, be naked and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of daily food: and one of you ſay unto them depart in peace, be ye warmed, and filled, notwithſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are needful to the body; What doth it profit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, True love is affirmative as well as negative (that is to ſay) doing good, as well as doing no harme. The affirmative part of charity is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: <hi>It ſuffereth long, and is kind: it rejoyceth in the truth, it beareth all</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:95743:134"/> 
                     <hi>things, believeth all things, hopeth all things.</hi> The negative part is: <hi>Charity envyeth not, vaunts not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, thinketh no evil, rejoyeeth not in iniquity,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The ground of true Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is not other mens carriage towards us: for this is heatheniſh love, <hi>to be friendly to thoſe that are friendly to us,</hi> Mat. 5. But Gods Commandment, who hath enjoyned us <hi>to love our neighbours as our ſelves:</hi> and therefore though we never: received any good from them; yea though we have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained much wrong by them; yet Gods Commandment muſt make us love them, and do them good.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Where true Charity is the Character of Gods Image in any man, it is an Adamant to draw out our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affections towards him; <hi>our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot extend to God;</hi> yet to the Saints that are in the earth it may, and ought; and <hi>our delight muſt be upon them that are excellent,</hi> Pſal. 16. 2, 3.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95743:134"/> There muſt be no confining of ſtinting our benevolence unto a few perſons, and not to others. We muſt <hi>love all, and do good to all:</hi> yet <hi>the Houſhold of Faith,</hi> muſt have the Principality, both in our benevolence, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
